## Daily Crate System

Every day you can earn up to 3 crates based on your activity level!

### How It Works

1. **On first login of the day**, a dismissible banner appears: "Your Daily Crate is ready!"
2. **Tap the banner** to open a bottom sheet with **3 mystery crates**
3. **Pick one crate** to reveal your reward (all 3 contain the same reward - the choice is just for fun!)
4. **Dismiss anytime** - the banner can be closed, and crates are also accessible from the XP/Profile section

**Note:** You can skip opening crates - they don't expire until midnight, and you can always access them later from your profile.

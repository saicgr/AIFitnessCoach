NEED TO IMPLEMENT and HAVE TO BE GOOD AT:
1. I like that I can change an exercise in the middle of the workout.
2. I love that I can modify the weights, reps, sets, and have it give me drop sets or supersets.
3. PPL, and other typical training splits work very well.
4. lack of sync with my galaxy watch holds the app back 
    I really wish there was an option to display my workouts on my Samsung watch to avoid having to be on my phone constantly while working out. The watch option would need to be just as functional as the app in displaying rest times, logging sets and allowing for weight/rep changes. That would make me change to a 5 star rating
5. The only thing I would suggest is to add more sports in the cardio section, a lot of people combine lifting weights with maybe Padel, Tenis or Soccer and would be good to be able to add those.
6. Unsure of how it calculates the reps and weights. Also nice if they would add muslce activation exercises and post workout stretches.
7. the one thing i wish, is that it add a hitt CrossFit workout
8. it would be even better if it included cardio record
9. I would love it even more if it had a stretching before and after the workout.
10. I'd love to be able to rearrange the work outs so I can start my week with legs instead of always chest.
11. Measure Cardio - need to be in miles and also meters
12. Google Health and Strava integration
13. UNSURE Changes to the app need to all be community recommended and voted on?
14. 1. Offline Access: There's no option to download assets for offline use, which quickly drained my mobile data - it could at least cache videos I watched before to help with data saving. 
    2. Exercise Customization: I'd like to set my own warm-up routines alongside the app's recommendations. There seem to be no way to keep static routing alongside the recommendations
15. there are only 2 sexes male and female anything else is mental illness and you cant calculate body fat percentage or know what exercises are safe or effective for a body needs without this very important scientific information. your information cant be trusted if your science is this inaccurate.
16. Garmin connect  

---------------------
NEED TO CHECK CAREFULLY AND IMPLEMENT:
1. I have a few pieces of equipment at home. In the first workout it told me to use a leg curl machine. Fine, I don't have one, but I found where in the app to edit the equipment I do have and made an update. Went back to do a workout...and it told me to do a leg curl machine. Nothing I could do would get it to regenerate the workout based on my current set up. That should be job one of using AI to power this activity--being able to change on the fly. Ugh.
2. it doesn't allow you to make your own exercise; i.e. a combo dumbbell bench press & chest fly.
3. It doesn't sync with my S watch, I'd love to be able to have the workouts sync with it so i can be less phone dependant during workouts & use my watch buzzing between sets and changing skipping sets ect
4. The set starting *ding ding* audio after rest doesnt work if the app is closed or ithe screen is off and it kills my battery. id love a 3 sec countdown exiting rest "bee bee boop--"
5. great app think it's a great idea but not a lot of freedom when it comes to changing to preferred methods great for people starting or getting back into the gym or even at home but not ideal for people just trying to track progress it's more for a variety of things to try
6. Can't provide much of a review because even if I set I have no equipment, the routines that are made for me have all types of equipment that I don't have. So I can't do the workouts. It's impossible to test the app under this condition.
7. Would give 5 stars if cardio exercises like running, air biking, and sledding were added to be able to track my full workout.    
8. Some of the split days are a little odd
9. I do have a couple complaints, though. It will calculate your estimate 1RM, but I would like for it to give the option to work out at a percentage of your 1RM; so, if I only wanted to do 70% of my max, I'd like for it to let me.
10. It had more Strongman type implements in its catalog of equipment like a Log, Axel bar, sandbag or atlas stones. I can create custom routines to track my Strongman sessions but I often have to just default to setting them up as using the Olympic Bar because they simply dont exist in the list.
11. for instance, there are two separate exercises for barbell hip thrusts and dumbbell hip thrusts. somehow if you can do 200 lbs in barbell it thinks you can only do 50 with a dumbbell.
12. Doesn't fit my use case. No matter what I did, it would suggest body weight exercises that I can't do with my leg immobilized due to injury. I only wanted upper body machine workouts. I finally got it to sort of work for my needs only to be hit with a $15 a month fee, which is just egregious. Give this a pass, it's just reordering workouts from a spreadsheet under the buzzwordS "AI GENERATED".

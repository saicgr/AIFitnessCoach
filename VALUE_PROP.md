<!-- PRIORITY #1: Make AI Coach Actually Work Like a Coach
Now THAT'S a clear value prop. That changes everything.
Replacing Human Fitness Coaches with AI
What a human coach does:
Human Coach	Your AI Needs To Do
Creates personalized program	✅ AI workout generation
Adjusts based on feedback	❓ Does it adapt when user says "too hard"?
Checks in weekly	❓ Does AI proactively reach out?
Answers questions anytime	❓ AI chat working?
Tracks progress over time	❓ Does AI reference past workouts?
Holds you accountable	❓ Notifications, streaks?
Knows your injuries/limitations	✅ User profile
Motivates when you're slacking	❓ Re-engagement?
Why people PAY $100-300/month for coaches:
Accountability - Someone checking if you did the work
Personalization - Not a generic PDF plan
Adaptation - Plan changes based on progress/life
Access - Can ask questions anytime
Expertise - Knows what to do for YOUR goals
The Real Retention Question
Users come back to a human coach because:
They paid money (sunk cost)
Coach texts them "Did you workout today?"
Coach adjusts their plan when they plateau
They have a relationship
Your AI needs to replicate this relationship.
What Makes AI Coach Sticky (Not Trash Talk)
Feature	Why It Creates Retention
Proactive check-ins	AI messages YOU first: "How was yesterday's workout?"
Adaptive plans	AI notices you're struggling and adjusts
Progress tracking	"You've increased squat weight 20% in 6 weeks"
Memory	"Last time you said your knee hurt - how is it now?"
Accountability	"You missed Monday - want to reschedule?"
The Key Differentiator
Human coach: $200/month Your AI coach: $10/month (or free) Same personalization, same check-ins, same adaptation - 1/20th the price.
Question: Is your AI currently able to:
Remember past conversations and reference them?
Proactively message users (push notifications)?
Adapt workouts based on user feedback?
These are the core features that replace a human coach - not trash talk. -->

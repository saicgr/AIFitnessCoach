## Addressing Common Fitness App Complaints

This app specifically addresses issues commonly reported in competitor apps:

### 1. "Lack of proper workout plans for full gym equipment"
✅ **SOLVED**: We support 23+ equipment types including commercial gym machines (leg press, hack squat, cable machines, Smith machine), free weights, and specialty equipment. Users can specify exact weights available.

### 2. "Warm-up exercises stay exactly the same when you change targeted muscle group"
✅ **SOLVED**: Dynamic warmup generator creates muscle-specific warmups based on the target workout. Leg day gets leg swings and lunges, chest day gets arm circles and chest openers. 7-day variety tracking ensures no repetition.

### 2b. "Warm-ups should have static holds early, not intermixed with kinetic moves"
✅ **SOLVED**: Warmup exercise ordering system that places static holds (planks, wall sits, dead hangs) at the BEGINNING of warmups, followed by dynamic movements (jumping jacks, arm circles, leg swings). This allows users to gradually increase their heart rate through movement after completing static activation exercises. The `order_warmup_exercises()` function automatically classifies and orders all warmup exercises.

### 2c. "Intervals shouldn't have any static holds - dangerous for the heart"
✅ **SOLVED**: HIIT/interval workout safety system that PREVENTS static holds from appearing in high-intensity interval workouts. Going from burpee box jumps to planks is dangerous for cardiovascular health. The system:
- Classifies exercises as 'static' or 'dynamic' using movement type detection
- Filters out static holds (planks, wall sits, isometrics) from interval/HIIT workouts
- Database validation function `validate_hiit_no_static_holds()` ensures safety
- HIIT templates (Tabata, EMOM, AMRAP) only include dynamic exercises

### 3. "Coach doesn't adjust the plan based on actual weights I'm using"
✅ **SOLVED**: All workout generation endpoints apply user's stored 1RM data to calculate personalized working weights. Historical weight data from completed workouts is used for recommendations.

### 4. "Tried to automatically put me in a more expensive tier"
✅ **SOLVED**: Plan change confirmation dialog shows clear price comparison (old vs new plan, price difference). Full subscription history visible to users. Upcoming renewal notifications 5 days and 1 day before charges.

### 5. "Generic reply that didn't address my concern"
✅ **SOLVED**: Full support ticket system with tracking IDs, status updates, and conversation threads. Users can create, track, and follow up on support tickets directly in-app.

### 6. "No refund option"
✅ **SOLVED**: In-app refund request flow with tracking ID. Users can request refunds with reason selection and get confirmation. Full audit trail of subscription changes.

### 7. "Time-based workouts lose seconds during transitions - need countdown between exercises"
✅ **SOLVED**: 5-10 second transition countdown between exercises with animated "GET READY" display, next exercise preview (name, sets, reps, thumbnail), skip button, and haptic feedback. Countdown turns orange in final 3 seconds with pulse animation.

### 8. "App should speak out the name of the next workout"
✅ **SOLVED**: Text-to-speech voice announcements available. When enabled, app announces "Get ready for [exercise name]" during transitions and "Congratulations! Workout complete!" at the end. Abbreviations are expanded (DB→dumbbell, BB→barbell) for clearer speech. Includes rest period countdown notifications and configurable voice guidance. Toggle in Settings > Voice Announcements.

### 8b. "Countdown timer sux plus cheesy applause smh. sounds should be customizable"
✅ **SOLVED**: Complete sound customization with 4 distinct sound categories and NO applause option:

**Sound Categories:**
1. **Countdown (3, 2, 1)**: Beep, Chime, Voice, Tick, or None - plays at 3, 2, 1 seconds before rest ends
2. **Rest Timer End**: Beep, Chime, Gong, or None - plays when rest period completes
3. **Exercise Complete**: Chime, Bell, Ding, Pop, Whoosh, or None - plays when all sets of an exercise are done
4. **Workout Complete**: Chime, Bell, Success, Fanfare, or None (NO applause!) - plays when entire workout finishes

**User Flow:**
1. Navigate to Settings > Sound Effects
2. Toggle each sound category on/off independently
3. Select preferred sound type from selection chips (with preview on tap)
4. Adjust master volume with slider (0-100%)
5. Preferences sync to cloud automatically

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Flutter Package**: `audioplayers ^6.1.0`
- **Audio Session**: Ducks Spotify/Apple Music during playback
- **Preloaded Sounds**: Instant playback with no delay
- **Backend API**: `GET/PUT /api/v1/sound-preferences`
- **Database**: `sound_preferences` table with exercise_completion fields (migration 093, 145)
- **Local Caching**: SharedPreferences for offline access

**Sound Triggers:**
- Countdown: 3, 2, 1 seconds before rest ends (active_workout_screen.dart)
- Rest End: When rest timer reaches 0 (active_workout_screen.dart)
- Exercise Complete: When user finishes all sets of an exercise (active_workout_screen.dart)
- Workout Complete: When all exercises in workout are done (workout_complete_screen.dart)

**Files:**
- Migration: `backend/migrations/093_sound_preferences.sql`, `145_exercise_completion_sounds.sql`
- Backend API: `backend/api/v1/sound_preferences.py`
- Flutter Service: `lib/data/services/sound_service.dart`

- Audio Assets: `assets/audio/countdown/`, `assets/audio/exercise_complete/`, `assets/audio/workout_complete/`, `assets/audio/rest_end/`

### 9. "Can't reset or change week's settings after starting"
✅ **SOLVED**: Program menu with "Regenerate This Week" option allows one-tap workout regeneration with current settings. "Customize Program" opens full wizard to change days, equipment, or difficulty. Edit Program Sheet now includes info tooltip explaining that changes regenerate workouts.

### 10. "Need extra advanced skill progressions like dragon squats, handstand pushups"
✅ **SOLVED**: Complete skill progression system with 7 progression chains (52 exercises total):
- **Pushup Mastery** (10 steps): Wall pushups → One-arm pushups
- **Pullup Journey** (8 steps): Dead hang → One-arm pullups
- **Squat Progressions** (8 steps): Assisted squats → Dragon squats, Pistol squats
- **Handstand Journey** (8 steps): Wall plank → Freestanding handstand pushups
- **Muscle-Up Mastery** (6 steps): High pullups → Strict muscle-ups
- **Front Lever Progressions** (6 steps): Hanging raises → Full front lever
- **Planche Progressions** (6 steps): Planche lean → Full planche

Each step includes difficulty rating (1-10), unlock criteria, tips, and video. Users track progress, log attempts, and unlock next levels.

### 11. "Too intense after a break - cruel to non-athletes, especially seniors"
✅ **SOLVED**: Comprehensive break detection and comeback system:
- **Auto-detection**: Detects breaks of 7, 14, 28, and 42+ days automatically
- **Comeback mode**: Reduced intensity workouts that gradually build back up over 1-4 weeks
- **Age-aware adjustments**: Additional intensity reduction for users 50+ (up to 25% extra reduction for 80+)
- **Example**: 70-year-old returning after 5 weeks gets ~55-60% volume reduction, 50% intensity reduction, +60-75s rest, max 4 exercises, no explosive movements
- **Rep capping**: Absolute maximums enforced (seniors 60+ max 12 reps, elderly 75+ max 10 reps) regardless of what AI generates
- **Rest time scaling**: Automatic 1.5x-2x rest for seniors

### 34. "I progressed too quickly with running and strained my calf - AI should make cardio more gradual"
✅ **SOLVED**: Comprehensive gradual cardio progression system (Couch-to-5K style):
- **Progressive Running Programs**: Structured 9-12 week programs with run/walk intervals that gradually increase
- **Multiple Pace Options**:
  - **Very Slow (12 weeks)**: 15s jog → 30min continuous, ideal for seniors and injury recovery
  - **Gradual (9 weeks)**: Standard C25K progression, safe for beginners
  - **Moderate (6 weeks)**: For those with base fitness
  - **Aggressive (4 weeks)**: For experienced athletes only
- **Age-Aware Auto-Adjustment**: Users 60+ automatically get "very_slow" pace, 50+ get pace downgrade
- **Strain Detection & Response**: Reporting strain automatically pauses progression and repeats current week
- **Perceived Difficulty Monitoring**: High difficulty (8+/10) triggers week extension before advancing
- **Session Tracking**: Each cardio session tracks run/walk intervals, duration, distance, heart rate, and strain status
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /cardio-progressions/` - Create new program
  - `GET /cardio-progressions/{program_id}/next-session` - Get next session details
  - `POST /cardio-progressions/{program_id}/report-strain` - Report strain with automatic adjustment
- **Database Tables**: `cardio_progression_programs`, `cardio_progression_sessions` with full RLS

### 35. "I strained my calf from overuse - app should prevent injury from too much volume"
✅ **SOLVED**: Complete strain/overuse injury prevention system:
- **The 10% Rule**: System enforces the proven training principle that weekly volume should not increase more than 10%
- **Weekly Volume Tracking**: Tracks total sets, reps, and volume (sets × reps × weight) per muscle group per week
- **Risk Level Detection**:
  - **Warning (10-15% increase)**: Caution message, monitor for fatigue
  - **Danger (15-20% increase)**: Reduce sets this week
  - **Critical (20%+ increase)**: Immediately reduce volume by 30%
- **Strain History Learning**: System learns from past strains to auto-adjust volume caps for vulnerable areas
- **Volume Alerts**: Proactive notifications when approaching dangerous volume increases
- **Automatic Workout Adjustment**: When risk is detected, exercises are auto-modified with reduced sets
- **Muscle-Specific Caps**: Personalized maximum weekly sets per muscle group based on history
- **API Endpoints**:

### 37. "I should have made the AI make the progression more gradual - need control over pace"
✅ **SOLVED**: User-controlled progression pace settings:
- **Pace Selection**: Users can choose their progression speed in Settings > Training Preferences:
  - **Extra Cautious (very_slow)**: 4+ successful sessions before any increase, 2.5% weight increments
  - **Gradual (slow)**: 3 successful sessions, 5% increments - recommended for beginners
  - **Balanced (moderate)**: 2 successful sessions, 7.5% increments - standard progression
  - **Aggressive (fast)**: Progress immediately when ready, 10% increments - athletes only
- **Category-Specific Pacing**: Different pace for strength vs cardio vs flexibility
  - Cardio defaults to "slow" for injury prevention
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: System analyzes user profile (age, fitness level, injury history, strain patterns) to recommend appropriate pace
- **Safety Limits**:
  - Max weekly volume increase % (default 10%)
  - Max weight increase % (default 10%)
  - Min sessions before progression (configurable 1-10)
  - Completion requirement % (must complete X% of prescribed before progressing)
- **Auto-Deload**: Configurable automatic deload weeks (every 3-8 weeks)

- **Database Tables**: `user_progression_preferences`, `progression_pace_definitions`

### 38. "Older person trying to get moving - need age-appropriate workout scaling"
✅ **SOLVED**: Comprehensive senior/recovery-aware workout scaling:
- **Age-Based Auto-Settings**: When user is 60+, senior settings auto-applied:
  - 60-64: 1.25x recovery, 80% max intensity, 8min extended warmup
  - 65-69: 1.5x recovery, 75% max intensity, 10min extended warmup
  - 70-74: 1.75x recovery, 70% max intensity, 12min extended warmup
  - 75+: 2x recovery, 65% max intensity, 15min extended warmup
- **Low-Impact Alternatives**: Automatic substitution of high-impact exercises:
  - Running → Walking
  - Jump Squats → Bodyweight Squats
  - Burpees → Step-Back Burpees
  - Box Jumps → Step-Ups
  - Jumping Lunges → Stationary Lunges
- **Recovery Status Check**: Before each workout, system checks if user has had enough rest since last workout
  - Minimum 2 rest days between strength workouts for seniors
  - Warnings if attempting workout too soon
- **Session Limits**:
  - Max 6 exercises per session
  - Max 3 sets per exercise
  - Max 12 reps per exercise
  - Extended rest periods (auto-multiplied by age factor)
- **Mandatory Mobility**: Mobility exercises auto-added to beginning of each workout (2+ exercises)
- **Workout Modifications Applied Automatically**:

- **Database Tables**: `senior_recovery_settings` with auto-trigger on user age change

### 12. "Given 90 squats when I selected 'easier' - no rep limits"
✅ **SOLVED**: Post-generation validation caps all exercises:
- **Fitness level caps**: Beginners max 12 reps/3 sets, Intermediate max 15 reps/4 sets, Advanced max 20 reps/5 sets
- **Age caps**: 60-74 max 12 reps, 75+ max 10 reps (overrides fitness level)
- **Absolute maximums**: Never more than 30 reps or 6 sets for anyone
- **Comeback reduction**: Additional 30% rep reduction for users returning from breaks
- **Warning logs**: System logs when excessive values are capped for monitoring

### 26. "Needs to give more control over sets and reps - 6 sets of 30+ reps is way too many"
✅ **SOLVED**: Complete user-customizable sets and reps control:
- **Max Sets Per Exercise**: User-configurable limit (2-8 sets) in Settings > Training Preferences > Rep Preferences
- **Min Sets Per Exercise**: User-configurable minimum (1-4 sets) to ensure adequate volume
- **Enforce Rep Ceiling Toggle**: Strictly enforce maximum rep limit when enabled

- **Post-Generation Enforcement**: Even if AI exceeds limits, validation function caps values to user preferences
- **API Integration**: `PUT /api/v1/exercise-preferences/sets-limits` endpoint for updating preferences
- **Database Schema**: `user_rep_range_preferences` table extended with `max_sets_per_exercise`, `min_sets_per_exercise`, `enforce_rep_ceiling`

### 27. "Totally out of progression with what I have been doing - ignores my history"
✅ **SOLVED**: History-based workout generation with pattern tracking:
- **Workout Patterns Table**: Tracks average sets/reps/weight per exercise across all sessions
- **Historical Context in Prompts**: Gemini receives user's actual performance data: "For Bench Press, user typically completes 3 sets of 10 reps at 60kg"
- **Adjustment Pattern Detection**: System identifies if user "often reduces sets" or "increases weight" and adjusts generation accordingly
- **Pre-Generation Context**: `get_user_workout_patterns()` fetches user's historical exercise data before generating workouts
- **Personalized Baselines**: For exercises user has done before, system uses their historical averages instead of generic defaults
- **Clear AI Instructions**: Prompts include "NEVER prescribe more than X sets per exercise" and "NEVER prescribe more than Y reps per set"
- **Post-Generation Validation**: `enforce_set_rep_limits()` function ensures user preferences are ALWAYS respected even if AI exceeds them

### 28. "Doesn't know what some exercises involve - dumbbell squat thrusters include shoulders, not just squats"
✅ **SOLVED**: Comprehensive compound exercise muscle mapping:
- **Exercise Muscle Mappings Table**: Stores all muscles worked by each exercise with involvement percentages
- **Multi-Muscle Tracking**: "Dumbbell Squat Thruster" correctly maps to Quadriceps (35%), Glutes (25%), Shoulders (20%), Triceps (10%), Core (10%)
- **Secondary Muscle Filtering**: When user avoids a muscle (e.g., shoulder injury), exercises are filtered if that muscle has >20% involvement
- **Helper Functions**:
  - `get_exercise_muscles(exercise_name)` - Returns all muscles for an exercise with percentages
  - `exercise_involves_muscle(exercise_name, muscle, min_involvement)` - Checks if exercise targets a muscle
  - `get_exercises_for_muscle(muscle, min_involvement, primary_only)` - Find exercises for a muscle group
- **Exercise Swap Awareness**: When swapping exercises, system compares muscle profiles and warns if swap significantly changes targeted muscles
- **Muscle Profile Comparison**: Shows similarity score, missing muscles, and new muscles when swapping
- **Pre-Seeded Data**: 15+ common compound exercises pre-populated with accurate muscle mappings (Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, Clean and Press, Burpees, Pull-ups, etc.)
- **RAG Service Integration**: Muscle filtering now checks both primary AND secondary muscles when applying injury/avoid preferences

### 29. "Spotify stops every 30 seconds while using the app"
✅ **SOLVED**: Complete audio session management for seamless music app integration:
- **Background Music Support**: App properly configures audio sessions to mix with other apps instead of interrupting them
- **Audio Ducking**: Temporarily lowers background music volume during voice announcements, then restores it
- **Platform-Specific Handling**:
  - iOS: AVAudioSessionCategory.playback with mixWithOthers and duckOthers options
  - Android: AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_MAY_DUCK for non-interruptive audio focus
- **User Preferences**: Full control in Settings > Audio Settings:
  - "Allow Background Music" toggle to keep Spotify/Apple Music playing
  - "Voice Announcement Volume" slider (0-100%)
  - "Audio Ducking" toggle to lower music during announcements
  - "Ducking Level" slider to control how much music is lowered
  - "Mute Voice During Videos" toggle for exercise demo videos
- **Proper Audio Focus Management**: Requests transient focus before TTS, abandons focus after completion
- **Backend Persistence**: User audio preferences synced to database with full API support
- **User Context Logging**: Tracks when users enable/disable background music for analytics

### 13. "Warmups are too long/short for my preference"
✅ **SOLVED**: Customizable warmup and stretch durations (1-15 minutes each). Users can set their preferred warmup length and post-workout stretch length in Settings > Training Preferences > Warmup Settings. The AI generates warmup routines tailored to the specified duration.

### 14. "Workouts don't adjust based on my feedback"
✅ **SOLVED**: Adaptive difficulty system learns from your exercise ratings (too easy / just right / too hard). The system tracks feedback patterns and automatically adjusts future workout difficulty. Consistent "too easy" ratings trigger progressive difficulty increases, while "too hard" feedback causes appropriate regression. Feedback importance is explained on the workout completion screen.

### 15. "Confusing UI - don't know what buttons do"
✅ **SOLVED**: Improved UI clarity throughout the app:
- Home screen edit mode includes tooltips explaining functionality
- Settings sections include descriptive headers explaining each category
- Workout completion screen explains the importance of exercise feedback
- Clearer navigation hints and contextual help throughout

### 14. "Exercise feedback doesn't seem to do anything"
✅ **SOLVED**: Exercise feedback now actively adjusts future workouts. The system uses a weighted algorithm considering recency, consistency, and feedback type to determine appropriate difficulty adjustments. Users receive visual confirmation that their feedback is being used.

### 16. "Can't adjust the amount of sets - stuck trying to complete 5 sets with nothing left"
✅ **SOLVED**: Complete set management system during active workouts:
- **Remove Sets**: Tap the minus button to reduce planned sets when fatigued
- **Skip Remaining Sets**: "I'm done with this exercise" option to end an exercise early
- **Edit Completed Sets**: Tap any completed set to modify reps or weight
- **Delete Sets**: Swipe to remove a logged set if entered incorrectly
- **Reason Tracking**: Optional reason selection (fatigue, time, pain, equipment) for analytics
- **Fatigue Detection**: AI monitors rep decline and RPE patterns, suggests reducing sets when appropriate
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows adjusted set count (e.g., "3/5 sets - reduced") with distinct styling
- **Smart Suggestions**: Based on performance decline, app proactively asks "Would you like to end this exercise early?"

This addresses the common frustration of being locked into a set count that doesn't match your energy level on a given day.

### 21. "Told me to do 50 crunches but I could only do 30 - no way to input actual reps"
✅ **SOLVED**: Complete rep accuracy tracking system:
- **Actual Rep Input**: Enter exactly how many reps you completed, not just accept the planned number
- **Target vs Actual Display**: UI shows "Target: 50" above input field, displays "Planned: 50 → Actual: 30" after completion
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Each set stores both planned and actual reps for accurate workout history
- **Visual Feedback**: Completed sets show accuracy percentage (e.g., "60%") with color coding (green=met target, orange=under target)
- **Quick Adjustment Buttons**: -5, -2 buttons for fast rep reduction from target
- **Modification Reasons**: Optional reason tracking (fatigue, pain, time) when reps differ from planned
- **AI Learning**: Rep accuracy data feeds into AI to automatically adjust future workout targets
- **Analytics View**: See your rep accuracy patterns per exercise over time
- **Database Tracking**: `set_rep_accuracy` table stores planned vs actual for every set

This addresses the frustration of workout logs showing incorrect data when you couldn't complete the planned reps.

### 18. "Strength journeys are too focused on high reps rather than progressions and leverage"
✅ **SOLVED**: Comprehensive leverage-based progression system that prioritizes exercise difficulty over rep increases:
- **Leverage Progressions**: 8 progression chains with 52+ variants (Push-up → Diamond → Archer → One-arm; Pull-up → Wide → Archer → One-arm; Squat → Bulgarian → Pistol)
- **Exercise Mastery Tracking**: System tracks consecutive "too easy" sessions per exercise
- **Automatic Suggestions**: After 2+ "too easy" ratings, app suggests harder variant instead of adding reps
- **Progression Cards**: Workout completion shows "Ready to Level Up?" cards with side-by-side difficulty comparison
- **Chain Types**: Supports leverage, load, stability, range-of-motion, and tempo progressions
- **Equipment-Aware**: Suggestions respect user's available equipment

### 19. "When exercise is too easy, app just adds reps which makes workouts boring"
✅ **SOLVED**: Smart progression philosophy embedded in AI generation:
- **Leverage-First Approach**: Gemini prompts explicitly instruct: "When exercise becomes easy, progress to HARDER VARIANT instead of adding more reps"
- **Rep Ceiling Enforcement**: AI instructed to never exceed user's preferred max reps
- **Mastery Context**: AI receives list of mastered exercises with suggested progressions
- **Example**: If user masters push-ups (15+ reps easily), next workout suggests Diamond Push-ups at lower rep range instead of 20 push-ups

### 20. "Takes too long to introduce pull-ups despite being able to do them"
✅ **SOLVED**: Exercise mastery fast-tracks progression:
- **Performance Detection**: If user completes 12+ reps on 70%+ of sets, exercise flagged as "ready for progression"
- **Manual Override**: Users can mark exercises as mastered to skip beginner variants
- **Prerequisite Skipping**: Users with demonstrated ability aren't forced through beginner progressions
- **Pull-up Chain**: Dead Hang → Scapular Pulls → Assisted → Negative → Full → Wide → L-Sit → Archer → One-arm (skip steps based on ability)

### 21. "Introduces high-rep muscle-ups without progression or starting with low rep range"
✅ **SOLVED**: Rep range preferences and progression validation:
- **Training Focus Settings**: Users choose Strength (4-6 reps), Hypertrophy (8-12), Endurance (12-15+), or Power (1-5)
- **Rep Range Slider**: Custom min/max rep preferences in Settings > Training Preferences
- **"Avoid Boring High-Rep Sets" Toggle**: When enabled, caps all exercises at 12 reps maximum
- **Progression Style**: Choose "Leverage First" (harder variants), "Load First" (more weight), or "Balanced"
- **Muscle-Up Mastery**: Proper 6-step progression: High Pullups → Explosive Pullups → Chest-to-Bar → Kipping → Slow → Strict

### 22. "Exercises and reps are repetitive and boring"
✅ **SOLVED**: Multi-layered variety enforcement:
- **Deduplication Logic**: 80%+ word overlap detection prevents similar exercises
- **7-14 Day Variety Tracking**: Avoids repeating exact exercises within window
- **Progression Variety**: When mastered, suggests lateral moves (Diamond Push-ups OR Decline Push-ups)
- **Training Focus Variation**: Gemini instructed to include variety and avoid same movement patterns
- **Chain Diversity**: 8 different progression chains covering all major movement patterns
- **Rep Range Variation**: Even within preferred range, varies rep targets (e.g., 8, 10, 12 across exercises)
- **Free Tier Access**: Users can skip paywall entirely and access core features free forever

### 18. "Info in store didn't say how much - had to download to get pricing"

### 44. "Only doing 500 steps a day - need help increasing daily activity" - NEAT Improvement System
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Comprehensive NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) improvement system to help sedentary users increase daily activity:

**The Problem:**
Many users only walk ~500 steps per day, which is extremely sedentary. Research shows that NEAT (all daily activity outside formal exercise) can add 300-500+ extra calories burned per day. The 10,000 steps goal is overwhelming for sedentary users and leads to disengagement.

**Our Solution - Progressive & Gamified:**

**1. Progressive Step Goals (Not One-Size-Fits-All)**
- **Personalized Starting Point**: New users start at their 7-day baseline average + 500 steps (not arbitrary 10,000)
- **Weekly Progression**: Goals automatically increase by 500-1000 steps/week when consistently achieved (80%+ achievement rate)
- **Smart Adjustments**: If struggling, system keeps goal stable or reduces slightly (never demotivates)
- **Goal Types**: Steps, active hours, and overall NEAT score tracking
- **Maximum Cap**: Goals capped at 15,000 steps to prevent overtraining

**2. Hourly Movement Reminders (Research-Backed)**
Based on Fitbit research showing 250 steps/hour threshold:
- **Sedentary Detection**: Hours with <250 steps flagged as sedentary
- **Smart Reminders**: Notification if sedentary for 1+ hours during allowed times
- **Quiet Hours**: Configurable (default 10PM-7AM) - no reminders during sleep
- **Work Hours Option**: Only remind during work hours (9AM-5PM)
- **Varied Messages**: 8+ different reminder templates to avoid notification fatigue:
  - "Time to move! 🚶 You've only taken {steps} steps this hour."
  - "Stand up and stretch! Your body will thank you."
  - "Quick walk? Just 2 minutes can boost your energy!"

**3. NEAT Score (0-100)**
Daily score calculated from multiple factors:
- Steps vs goal (0-40 points)
- Active hours (0-35 points)
- Consistency/distribution (0-25 points with sedentary penalties)
- **Rating Levels**: Excellent (90+), Good (75-89), Fair (50-74), Needs Improvement (<50)
- **Trend Tracking**: Shows improving/stable/declining over time

**4. Comprehensive Streak System**
Four independent streak types:
- **Step Goal Streak**: Consecutive days meeting step goal
- **Active Hours Streak**: Consecutive days with 8+ active hours
- **NEAT Score Streak**: Consecutive days with score >= 70
- **Movement Breaks Streak**: Consecutive days avoiding 2+ hour sedentary periods
- **Milestone Celebrations**: Badges at 7, 14, 30, 60, 100 day milestones

**5. Gamification & Achievements (35+ Badges)**
Tiered achievement system:
| Tier | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Bronze** | First 5K Steps, 3-Day Streak, 8 Active Hours |
| **Silver** | 10K Steps, 7-Day Streak, Active Week, First 75 NEAT |
| **Gold** | 15K Steps, Monthly Master, Active Month, Perfect NEAT |
| **Platinum** | 20K Steps, 60-Day Streak, Consistency Champion |
| **Diamond** | 25K Steps, Century Walker (100-day streak), Step Olympian |

**6. NEAT Dashboard UI**

### 46. "How does AI know my actual strength level vs what I said in onboarding?" - Calibration/Test Workout System
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Complete strength calibration workout system to validate user-reported fitness levels:

**The Problem:**
Users often misjudge their fitness level during onboarding. Someone might select "intermediate" but actually be advanced, or vice versa. Without real data, the AI generates workouts that are either too easy or too hard, leading to frustration and poor workout personalization.

**Our Solution - Post-Subscription Calibration:**

**1. Calibration Workout (Optional, ~15-20 minutes)**
- **Triggered After Subscription**: Users see calibration intro after paywall purchase (can skip)
- **Quick Assessment**: 3-5 basic exercises testing major movement patterns
- **Exercise Types**:
  - Upper Push: Push-ups or Bench Press (based on equipment)
  - Upper Pull: Pull-ups or Dumbbell Rows
  - Lower Body: Squats or Bodyweight Squats
  - Shoulders: Shoulder Press (if equipment available)
  - Core: Plank (timed)
- **Max Rep Tests**: Users perform each exercise to their max ability

**2. AI Analysis with Gemini**
After completing calibration:
- **Performance Analysis**: AI reviews reps completed, weights used, and perceived difficulty
- **Strength Level Assessment**: Determines actual strength level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- **Comparison**: Compares actual performance vs self-reported fitness level
- **Recommendations**: Provides personalized recommendations for training

**3. Suggested Adjustments**
If calibration reveals a mismatch:
- **Fitness Level Adjustment**: "Based on your performance, we recommend changing your fitness level from 'beginner' to 'intermediate'"
- **Accept/Decline**: Users can accept the suggestion or keep original settings
- **Confidence Score**: Shows how confident the AI is in its assessment

**4. Strength Baselines**
From calibration results, the system calculates:
- **Estimated 1RM**: Uses Brzycki formula (1RM = weight × 36 / (37 - reps))
- **Working Weight Suggestions**: Baseline weights for future workouts
- **Muscle Group Baselines**: Strength levels per muscle group

**5. Recalibration**
- **30-Day Cool Down**: Can recalibrate after 30 days
- **Settings Access**: Available in Settings > Workout & Training > Calibration
- **Track Progress**: See how strength baselines change over time

**User Flow:**
```
Onboarding → Paywall → Calibration Intro → Start/Skip
                              ↓ (if start)
                       Calibration Workout

### 47. "Falls short for its library and ability to input cooked grains - barcode scanner shows 'Item not found' for well-known drinks"
✅ **SOLVED**: Complete nutrition tracking enhancement addressing four major pain points:

**The Problem (from competitor review):**
Users complained about: (1) Limited food database requiring constant manual additions, (2) No ability to input cooked grains (only raw weights), (3) Barcode scanner showing "Item not found" for well-known products that appear in manual search, (4) Premium subscription not worth it due to these limitations.

**Our Solutions:**

**1. Enhanced Barcode Scanner with Fuzzy Search Fallback**
When a barcode lookup fails in Open Food Facts:
- **Automatic Fuzzy Search**: If barcode not found, system immediately searches by product name/brand hints
- **Alternative Product Suggestions**: Shows up to 5 similar products with similarity scores (60%+ threshold)
- **Manual Match**: Users can select an alternative and system remembers this match for future scans
- **Barcode Cache**: 24-hour caching of lookup results to avoid repeated API calls
- **Missing Barcode Reporting**: Users can report missing barcodes for future improvement
- **Match Reasons**: Shows why each alternative was suggested (similar_name, same_brand, category_match)

**2. Cooked/Prepared Food Weight Converter**
Solves the "cooked grains" problem with comprehensive raw↔cooked conversions:
- **55+ Food Conversion Factors**: Covering grains, legumes, meats, poultry, seafood, vegetables, eggs
- **Bidirectional Conversion**: Input raw weight → get cooked weight, OR input cooked weight → get raw weight
- **Cooking Method Awareness**: Different factors for grilling vs boiling vs baking (e.g., chicken breast: 0.75 grilled, 0.80 poached)
- **Nutritional Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts calories/protein/carbs per 100g based on water absorption/loss
- **Example Conversions**:
  - 100g raw white rice → 250g cooked (2.5x, absorbs water)
  - 100g raw chicken breast → 75g grilled (0.75x, loses moisture)
  - 100g raw pasta → 200g cooked (2.0x, absorbs water)
  - 100g raw spinach → 10g sautéed (0.10x, wilts dramatically)
- **Food Categories**: GRAINS (rice, pasta, oats, quinoa), LEGUMES (lentils, beans, chickpeas), MEATS (beef, pork, lamb), POULTRY (chicken, turkey), SEAFOOD (salmon, tuna, shrimp), VEGETABLES (spinach, mushrooms, potatoes), EGGS

**3. Recent/Frequent Foods Quick Re-Logging**

### 49. "Too slow and convoluted to track meals - useless AI food tips after each meal logged"
✅ **SOLVED**: Complete nutrition tracking UX overhaul addressing speed, simplicity, and user control:

**The Problem (from competitor review):**
Users complained: "Too slow and convoluted to track meals. Need a way to disable the useless (and incorrect) AI food tips after each meal logged. Between that, the lag when searching for foods, and the various submenus for foods/meals/recipes, it's too much. Even saving common foods as a meal and selecting that every morning feels slower than other apps."

**Our Solutions:**

**1. Toggle to Disable AI Food Tips**
- **New Setting**: "Disable AI Food Tips" toggle in Settings > Nutrition Settings
- **Immediate Effect**: When enabled, no AI suggestions/warnings shown after logging meals
- **User Control**: Users can re-enable anytime if they want feedback back
- **Additional Settings**: Quick log mode, compact tracker view, show macros on log toggles
- **Database**: `user_nutrition_preferences` table stores all UI preferences

**2. Quick Add Button - Minimal-Tap Meal Logging**
- **Floating Action Button**: Quick Add FAB appears on nutrition screen (when enabled)
- **2-Tap Maximum**: Open sheet → tap food → logged (no confirmation needed)
- **Quick Add Sheet Contents**:
  - **Favorites Section**: Top 8 most-logged foods as tappable chips
  - **Recent Section**: Last 5 logged meals with meal type, time, calories
  - **Recipes Section**: User's meal templates for one-tap logging
  - **Manual Entry**: "Log something else" opens full sheet only when needed
- **Auto Meal Type**: Detects time of day (breakfast 5-11am, lunch 11am-3pm, snack 3-6pm, dinner 6pm+)
- **Instant Feedback**: Brief snackbar "Logged: Coffee - 5 cal" then auto-closes

**3. Instant Food Search with Debouncing & Caching**
- **300ms Debounce**: Prevents API spam while typing
- **LRU Memory Cache**: 50 items, 5-minute TTL for instant repeat searches
- **Server-Side Cache**: `food_search_cache` table with 7-day TTL
- **Parallel Search**: Searches saved foods, recent logs, and database simultaneously
- **Performance**: First keystroke to results < 500ms for cached queries
- **Search States**: Loading, results (categorized), error, initial states
- **Material 3 Search Bar**: Animated focus, filter chips (All/Saved/Recent)

**4. Unified Food Library (Single View for All Foods)**

- **Servings Multiplier**: Optional servings parameter (default 1.0)
- **Pre-Calculated Nutrition**: Uses stored values, no API call to Gemini
- **Quick Log History**: `quick_log_history` table tracks frequency for smart suggestions
- **Time-of-Day Buckets**: morning/afternoon/evening/night for better suggestions

**6. Redesigned Tracker Layout (Meals at Top)**
- **Previous Layout Issues**: 11+ components, meals buried at bottom (#11)
- **New Compact Energy Header**: Calories eaten | progress bar | remaining (single row)
- **Meals Moved to Top**: Immediately after energy header
- **Collapsible Analytics**: All analytics cards grouped under "View Analytics" section
- **Compact Mode**: When enabled, analytics collapsed by default
- **Quick Favorites**: Inline with meals section for easy access

**7. Meal Templates (Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner Presets)**
- **Create Templates**: Save common meals as templates with all nutrition data

### 50. "Need a holistic plan that coordinates workouts, nutrition, and fasting together"
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Full Weekly Plan feature that tightly integrates workouts, nutrition targets, and fasting windows into a unified planning system.

**The Problem:**
Users with multiple fitness goals (strength training + fasting + nutrition tracking) had to manually coordinate between different app sections. There was no unified view showing how workout days affect nutrition needs or how fasting windows should align with training times. This led to:
- Same calorie targets on training and rest days (inefficient)
- Fasted training without warnings or supplementation guidance
- Meal timing that didn't account for eating windows
- No AI-generated meal suggestions to hit macro targets

**Our Solution - Holistic Weekly Planning:**

**1. Workout-Aware Nutrition Adjustments**
Automatic daily calorie and macro adjustments based on training:
| Day Type | Calorie Adjustment | Protein Adjustment | Carbs Adjustment |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **High Intensity Training** | +350 cal | +30g | +50g |
| **Moderate Training** | +250 cal | +20g | +30g |
| **Light Training/Active Recovery** | +150 cal | +15g | +20g |
| **Rest Day** | Base targets | Base targets | Base targets |
| **Cutting Phase Rest** | -200 cal | Base protein | Reduced carbs |

**2. Fasting-Workout Coordination**
Smart coordination warnings and scheduling:
- **Optimal Timing Detection**: Identifies when workout fits within eating window
- **Fasted Training Warnings**: Alerts with BCAA recommendations for morning workouts during 16:8 fasting
- **Extended Fast Detection**: Extra warnings for workouts during 18:6, 20:4, or OMAD protocols
- **Post-Workout Window**: Ensures time for post-workout nutrition before fast begins
- **Automatic Window Adjustments**: Optional adjustment of eating window to match workout schedule

**3. AI-Generated Meal Suggestions**
Each day includes meal suggestions tailored to targets and timing:
- **Training Day Meals**: Include pre-workout (2-3h before) and post-workout (within 2h) meals
- **Macro Matching**: Total daily suggestions match calorie/protein targets
- **Eating Window Compliance**: All meals fit within fasting eating window
- **Food Preferences**: Respects dietary restrictions and cuisine preferences
- **One-Tap Logging**: "Log this meal" button for quick tracking

**4. Weekly Plan View**
Unified calendar view showing the complete picture:
- **7-Day Overview**: Training days, rest days, at a glance
- **Daily Breakdown**: Tap any day to see full details
- **Nutrition Progress**: Macro rings for each day

## Competitor Complaint Response: Why We're Different

The following section addresses specific user complaints from competitor app reviews and how FitWiz solves each one.

### Complaint: "Definitely not for beginners - exercises way too difficult, can only skip 3, settings don't help"

A user reviewed a competitor app saying: *"The problem isn't the number of reps—it's the exercises themselves, which are way too difficult for someone who's never trained before. Sure, you can skip a few of the hardest ones, but only three. Changing settings or recreating workouts doesn't lower the difficulty at all. If you're a complete beginner like me, it's absolutely useless."*

**Our Comprehensive Beginner Support System:**

| Issue | Competitor | FitWiz Solution |
|-------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Exercises too difficult** | Advanced exercises given to beginners | **Difficulty Ceiling System**: Beginners only see exercises rated 1-3 (out of 10). Pull-ups, muscle-ups, pistol squats are filtered out. |
| **Limited skips (only 3)** | Can only skip 3 exercises | **Unlimited Skips + Swaps**: Skip any exercise, get AI-suggested alternatives, no limits. |
| **Settings don't help** | Changing settings has no effect | **Fitness-Level-Aware Generation**: All workout parameters respect fitness level during generation. |
| **Recreating doesn't lower difficulty** | Regeneration ignores user level | **Smart Regeneration**: Uses difficulty ceiling + fitness level caps + feedback adjustments. |

**Technical Implementation:**

1. **Difficulty Ceiling System** (`services/exercise_rag/service.py`):
   - Beginners: Only easy exercises (difficulty 1-3 out of 10)
   - Intermediates: Easy-medium (1-6 out of 10)
   - Advanced: All exercises allowed (1-10)

2. **Beginner Parameter Caps** (`services/adaptive_workout_service.py`):
   - **Max 3 sets** (not 4-5 like intermediates)
   - **6-12 reps** (focused on form, not endurance)
   - **+30 seconds extra rest** between sets
   - **Reduced exercise count** per workout

3. **Unlimited Exercise Management**:
   - Skip any exercise during workout (no 3-skip limit)
   - Swap for AI-suggested alternatives targeting same muscles
   - Add exercises if desired
   - Remove sets when fatigued

4. **Adaptive Difficulty from Feedback**:
   - Rate exercises as "too easy", "just right", or "too hard"
   - System adjusts difficulty ceiling by ±2 based on feedback patterns
   - Consistent "too hard" ratings → regression to easier exercises
   - Tracked in `difficulty_adjustments` table for transparency

5. **Leverage-Based Progressions** (not just rep increases):
   - Wall Push-ups → Incline → Knee → Standard → Diamond → Archer
   - Assisted Squats → Bodyweight → Goblet → Barbell → Pistol
   - Dead Hang → Scapular Pulls → Assisted Pull-ups → Negatives → Full

**Database Tables Supporting Beginners:**
- `exercise_feedback` - Tracks difficulty ratings per exercise
- `difficulty_adjustments` - Logs feedback-based ceiling changes
- `user_rep_range_preferences` - User's preferred rep limits
- `avoided_exercises` - Exercises user wants to skip permanently

**Tests Validating Beginner Safety:**
- `test_beginner_workout_parameters.py` - Verifies caps are enforced
- `test_exercise_difficulty_filter.py` - Ensures advanced exercises filtered
- `test_feedback_adjustment.py` - Validates adaptive difficulty works

### Complaint: "No option to extract workout logs in text format + Navigation requires multiple clicks"

A user reviewed a competitor app saying: *"Missing features: There is no option to extract workout logs in a text format. The navigation is not so good (multiple clicks can be reduced to single click at number of places). The way images show up is also not smooth, one needs to click 2-3 times."*

**Our Solutions:**

#### 1. Text Export - IMPLEMENTED

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Plain Text Export** | New `/api/v1/users/{user_id}/export-text` endpoint returns formatted workout logs |
| **Format Toggle** | Export dialog offers "CSV/ZIP" or "Plain Text" format selection |
| **Date Range Filter** | Optional start_date/end_date parameters for filtering |
| **Readable Format** | Structured text with workout headers, exercise lists, sets/reps/weight/RPE |

**Example Output:**
```
====================================================================
AI FITNESS COACH - WORKOUT LOG EXPORT
Generated: 2025-12-30
Period: 2025-01-01 to 2025-12-30
====================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKOUT: Upper Body Strength
Date: Monday, December 30, 2025
Duration: 45 minutes | Total Sets: 12 | Total Reps: 96 | Total Volume: 1440.0 kg
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Bench Press
   Set 1: 60 kg x 10 reps (RPE 7)
   Set 2: 60 kg x 8 reps (RPE 8)

2. Barbell Row
   Set 1: 50 kg x 12 reps
...
```

**Files:**
- Backend service: `services/data_export.py` - `export_workout_logs_text()` function
- API endpoint: `api/v1/users.py` - GET `/export-text`
- Flutter UI: `screens/settings/dialogs/export_dialog.dart` - Format selector
- Tests: `tests/test_text_export.py` - 27 test cases

#### 2. Reduced Navigation Clicks - IMPLEMENTED

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Exercise video viewing** | 2-3 clicks (open sheet → tap video → tap play) | 1 click (open sheet → auto-plays) |
| **Video loading feedback** | No indicator, abrupt appearance | Smooth fade-in with loading animation |
| **Accessibility** | No consideration | Respects reduced motion settings |

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Auto-play on open**: Videos start automatically when `ExerciseDetailSheet` opens
- **Delayed start**: 300ms delay after sheet animation completes
- **Video caching**: First checks local cache, uses `VideoPlayerController.file()` for faster loading
- **Smooth fade-in**: `FadeTransition` animation when video is ready
- **Enhanced loading indicator**: Dual-ring animation with "Will auto-play when ready" text
- **Retry button**: For failed loads, users can tap to retry

**Files:**
- `screens/library/components/exercise_detail_sheet.dart` - Auto-play + fade-in
- `screens/library/widgets/netflix_exercise_carousel.dart` - Consistent behavior
- Uses `video_cache_provider.dart` for cached video support

A user review of a competitor fitness app highlighted these specific complaints. Here's how FitWiz addresses each one:

### Complaint: "Coach randomly assigns same 15 exercises regardless of what equipment you select"
**Our Solution**:
- **1,722+ exercises** in our database with detailed equipment requirements
- **23+ equipment types** supported with quantities and weight specifications
- **Equipment-aware filtering**: Exercises are filtered at RAG query time to only return exercises matching user's equipment
- **Backend validation**: `equipment_available` list is cross-referenced during workout generation
- **Settings integration**: Users can update equipment anytime in Settings > Training Preferences > My Equipment

### Complaint: "Equipment you choose has no effect on workouts"
**Our Solution**:
- Equipment flows through the entire generation pipeline:
  1. **Onboarding**: Users select environment + detailed equipment with quantities
  2. **RAG Service**: `services/exercise_rag/service.py` filters by `equipment_available`
  3. **LangGraph Agent**: Exercise suggestion nodes validate equipment compatibility
  4. **Generation**: `workouts/generation.py` includes equipment in Gemini prompts
  5. **Fallback**: If AI suggests unavailable equipment, validation catches and substitutes
- **Equipment persistence**: Stored in `users` table and passed to every workout generation call

### Complaint: "Indicating workout was too easy/too hard doesn't change anything"
**Our Solution**:
- **Difficulty feedback system**: -2 to +2 scale (Way Too Easy → Way Too Hard)
- **Feedback persistence**: Stored in `exercise_feedback` table with timestamps
- **Weighted algorithm**: `feedback_analysis_service.py` considers recency and consistency
- **Automatic adjustments**: Consistent "too easy" ratings trigger progressive increases
- **Visual confirmation**: Workout completion screen explains feedback importance
- **ChromaDB integration**: Exercise feedback stored in RAG for personalized suggestions

### Complaint: "Warmup is ALWAYS the same regardless of what muscle group you're working"
**Our Solution**:
- **Dynamic warmup generation**: `warmup_stretch_service.py` generates muscle-specific warmups
- **Target muscle extraction**: Warmups analyze workout exercises to identify primary muscles
- **7-day variety tracking**: `warmup_stretch_tracking` table prevents repetition
- **Muscle-specific movements**:
  - Leg day → leg swings, hip circles, lunges
  - Chest day → arm circles, chest openers, shoulder rotations
  - Back day → cat-cow, thoracic rotations
- **Migration 078**: `warmup_stretch_target_muscles` adds muscle targeting to database

### Complaint: "No option to select push/pull/legs or a specific muscle group"
**Our Solution**:
- **8 training splits** supported:
  - `push_pull_legs` - Classic 6-day split
  - `upper_lower` - 4-day upper/lower rotation
  - `full_body` - 3x/week total body
  - `body_part` - Bro split (chest, back, shoulders, arms, legs)
  - `phul` - Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower
  - `arnold_split` - Chest/Back, Shoulders/Arms, Legs
  - `hyrox` - Hybrid functional training
  - `dont_know` - AI selects optimal split
- **Settings access**: Training Split selector in Settings > Training Preferences
- **Focus area targeting**: `/generate-now` endpoint accepts specific muscle groups
- **Mood-based generation**: Quick workout card allows muscle group selection

### Complaint: "You cannot edit any exercise in the predetermined routine"
**Our Solution**:
- **AI-powered exercise swap**: `ExerciseSwapSheet` in active workout screen
- **Smart suggestions**: LangGraph agent provides alternatives targeting same muscles
- **Multiple options**: 3+ AI-suggested replacements plus manual search
- **Equipment-aware**: Suggestions respect user's available equipment
- **Persistence**: Swaps saved to backend and reflected in workout history
- **Inline editing**: Tap any exercise during workout to access swap sheet
- **Add exercises**: "Add Exercise" button to include additional movements

### Complaint: "Doesn't let you create custom workouts, forces programs, limits to 5 days - made for beginners only"

A user reviewed a competitor app saying: *"This app is abysmal for anybody that has any real training experience. Despite containing a lot of exercises, it doesn't let you create and update your own custom workouts. It forces you to use their own programs, which is brain dead if you are anything but a complete beginner. Despite being a workout app, it doesn't let you set more than 5 days of training per week, so my six day split can say bye. Let's be honest, this app is made for people who don't really know anything about fitness."*

### 43. "The app doesn't help me pick weights or rest times during workouts"
✅ **SOLVED**: Complete AI-Powered Real-Time Workout Intelligence system

---

## AI-Powered Real-Time Workout Intelligence

> **The AI coach that learns and adapts during your workout in real-time.**

FitWiz includes a sophisticated AI system that provides intelligent suggestions throughout your workout. Unlike static workout plans, this system adapts to your actual performance, detecting fatigue, suggesting optimal weights, and recommending rest times based on how you're actually performing.

---

### Feature 1: Smart Weight Auto-Fill

**What it does:** Automatically suggests the optimal weight before each set based on your strength data.

#### How It Works
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BENCH PRESS - SET 1 OF 3                     💡 AI        │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│                                                             │
│  Weight: [  45.0 kg  ]  ← Auto-filled                      │
│                                                             │
│  📊 Based on your 60kg 1RM at 75% intensity                │
│  📈 Last session: 42.5kg × 10 @ RPE 6 (you crushed it!)    │
│                                                             │
│  [ - ]  [ + ]                    [Complete Set]            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Calculation Formula
```
suggested_weight = 1RM × target_intensity% × performance_modifier
```

Where:
- **1RM**: Your one-rep max for this exercise (from strength records)
- **Target Intensity**: Based on training goal:
  | Goal | Intensity Range | Typical Reps |
  |------|-----------------|--------------|
  | Strength | 85-95% | 1-5 reps |
  | Hypertrophy | 65-80% | 8-12 reps |
  | Endurance | 50-65% | 15-20+ reps |
  | Power | 70-85% | 3-6 reps |
- **Performance Modifier**: Adjusts based on last session
  - Crushed it (RPE 6-7 with target reps): +5%
  - Normal (RPE 8): No change
  - Struggled (RPE 9-10 or missed reps): -5%

#### Equipment-Aware Rounding
| Equipment Type | Increment | Example |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Dumbbells | 2.5 kg | 23.7 → 22.5 or 25.0 |
| Barbells | 2.5 kg | 61.3 → 60.0 or 62.5 |
| Machines | 5.0 kg | 42.0 → 40.0 or 45.0 |
| Cables | 5.0 kg | 33.0 → 35.0 |

#### First-Time User Flow
For new users without 1RM data:
1. **No 1RM stored** → Use conservative starting weights based on:
   - User's fitness level (beginner/intermediate/advanced from onboarding)
   - Body weight (for bodyweight-relative exercises)
   - Exercise difficulty rating
2. **After first workout** → System calculates estimated 1RM from performance
3. **Subsequent workouts** → Full AI suggestions with increasing accuracy

---

### Feature 2: AI Rest Time Suggestions

**What it does:** Recommends optimal rest duration after each set based on how hard it was.

#### How It Works

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Rest Time Categories
| Category | Duration | When Used | Exercise Types |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Short** | 30-60s | RPE 6-7, light work | Isolation, accessories |
| **Moderate** | 90-120s | RPE 7-8, standard work | Most exercises |
| **Long** | 150-180s | RPE 8-9, heavy work | Compound lifts |
| **Extended** | 180-300s | RPE 9-10, max effort | Strength/power sets |

#### Factors Considered
1. **RPE of completed set** (primary factor)
2. **Exercise type** (compound vs isolation)
3. **Set number** (later sets need more rest due to fatigue)
4. **Remaining sets** (conserve energy if many left)
5. **User's training goal** (strength needs more rest than endurance)

#### Fatigue Multiplier
| Set Number | Multiplier | Effect |
|------------|------------|--------|
| Set 1-2 | 1.0x | Baseline rest |
| Set 3 | 1.05x | +5% rest time |
| Set 4 | 1.10x | +10% rest time |
| Set 5+ | 1.15x | +15% rest time |

### Feature 5: Auto-RPE Estimation

**What it does:** Estimates your RPE when you skip entering it manually.

#### How It Works
When user doesn't input RPE, the system estimates it using:

```
Estimated RPE = f(weight_used, reps_completed, estimated_1RM)
```

Based on the Tuchscherer/Helms RPE-Reps-Percentage tables:

| Reps | @RPE 6 | @RPE 7 | @RPE 8 | @RPE 9 | @RPE 10 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 | 85% | 89% | 92% | 96% | 100% |
| 3 | 79% | 82% | 85% | 89% | 92% |
| 5 | 74% | 77% | 80% | 84% | 87% |
| 8 | 67% | 70% | 73% | 77% | 80% |
| 10 | 62% | 65% | 68% | 72% | 75% |
| 12 | 57% | 60% | 63% | 67% | 70% |

**Example**: User lifts 45kg for 8 reps, 1RM is 60kg
- 45/60 = 75% of 1RM
- At 8 reps, 75% falls between RPE 8-9
- System displays: "Estimated RPE: 8.5"

## Learning & Improvement

The AI system continuously improves by tracking:

1. **Acceptance Rate**: % of suggestions user accepts
   - Weight suggestions: Target >70%
   - Rest suggestions: Target >60%
   - Fatigue alerts: Track response patterns

2. **Modification Patterns**: When users modify suggestions
   - If users consistently add +5kg, increase base suggestions
   - If users consistently reduce rest, shorten recommendations

3. **Performance Correlation**: Does following AI improve results?
   - Track PRs after accepting vs rejecting suggestions
   - Adjust confidence scores based on outcomes

### Analytics Views
```sql
-- Suggestion acceptance rates per user
CREATE VIEW ai_suggestion_acceptance_rates AS
SELECT
  user_id,
  suggestion_type,
  COUNT(*) as total_suggestions,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE user_action = 'accepted') as accepted,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE user_action = 'accepted') / COUNT(*), 1) as acceptance_rate
FROM ai_workout_suggestions
WHERE user_action IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY user_id, suggestion_type;
```

## AI-Powered Home Screen Insights

### Overview

The home screen now features AI-powered insights that provide personalized coaching tips, weight trend analysis, and habit recommendations. All AI features are powered by Gemini and cached to minimize API calls.

### Features

#### 1. AI Daily Tips (Coach Tip Card)

**What it does**: Displays a personalized coaching tip based on user's workout history, goals, and time of day.

**Location**: Home screen → Coach Tip tile

**User Flow**:
```
1. User opens home screen
2. Card shows loading state: "Getting your personalized tip..."
3. Backend checks cache (24h TTL)
4. If cache miss → Gathers user context → Calls Gemini
5. Personalized tip appears
6. User can tap "Ask coach for more" → Opens AI chat
```

**Context Used for Personalization**:
- User's fitness goals
- Last workout type (legs, push, pull, etc.)
- Days since last workout
- Current workout streak
- Most trained muscle groups
- Time of day (morning/afternoon/evening)

**Example Tips**:
- Morning after leg day: "Great leg session yesterday! Focus on upper body mobility today to stay balanced."
- Evening with 5-day streak: "Five days strong! Consider active recovery tomorrow - a 20-min walk does wonders."
- 3 days since last workout: "It's been a few days since your last workout. Even a 20-minute session helps maintain momentum!"

**API Endpoint**: `GET /insights/{user_id}/daily-tip`

---

#### 2. AI Weight Insights

**What it does**: Analyzes the user's weight trend over 7-14 days and provides personalized feedback and actionable tips.

**Location**: Can be added to Weight Trend tile or Progress screen

**User Flow**:
```
1. User has logged weight at least 2 times in the past 14 days
2. Backend calculates weekly change and direction (losing/gaining/maintaining)
3. Gemini generates insight based on:
   - Weight data points
   - User's primary goal
   - Target weight (if set)
   - Current trend direction
4. Insight displayed with actionable tip
```

**Example Insights**:
- Fat loss goal, down 2 lbs: "You're down 2.1 lbs this week! Your consistency is paying off. Try adding an extra serving of protein to maximize muscle retention."
- Maintaining, muscle building goal: "Your weight is stable this week. To continue building muscle, consider increasing calories by 100-200 on training days."
- Gaining on fat loss goal: "You've gained 1.2 lbs. Review your weekend eating patterns - that's often where extra calories sneak in."

**API Endpoint**: `GET /insights/{user_id}/weight-insight`

---

#### 3. AI Habit Suggestions

**What it does**: Suggests 2-3 personalized habits based on user's goals and current habits.

**User Flow**:
```
1. User views habits section (or first time setting up habits)
2. Backend checks current active habits
3. Gemini suggests NEW habits not already tracked
4. Each suggestion includes:
   - Habit name
   - Brief reason why it helps their goal
5. User can tap to add suggested habit
```

**Available Habit Templates**:
- No DoorDash today
- No eating out
- No sugary drinks
- No late-night snacking
- Cook at home
- No alcohol
- Drink 8 glasses water
- 10k steps
- Stretch for 10 minutes
- Sleep by 11pm
- No processed foods
- Meal prep Sunday
- Track all meals
- Take vitamins

**Example Response**:
```json
[
  {"name": "No late-night snacking", "reason": "Helps control daily calorie intake for fat loss"},
  {"name": "10k steps daily", "reason": "Boosts NEAT and increases calorie burn by 200-300 cals"},
  {"name": "Meal prep Sunday", "reason": "Reduces reliance on takeout during busy weekdays"}
]
```

**API Endpoint**: `GET /insights/{user_id}/habit-suggestions`

---

### Caching Strategy

All AI insights are cached to minimize Gemini API calls and improve response times:

| Insight Type | Cache Duration | Cache Key |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Daily Tip | 24 hours | `daily_tip_{user_id}_{date}` |
| Weight Insight | 24 hours | `weight_insight_{user_id}` |
| Habit Suggestions | 1 week (168 hours) | `habit_suggestions_{user_id}` |

**Cache Table**: `ai_insight_cache`
```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_insight_cache (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    cache_key VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    insight TEXT,
    expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

### Fallback Behavior

If Gemini API fails, the system provides fallback responses:

| Insight Type | Fallback Logic |
|-------------|----------------|
| Daily Tip | Time-based tips (morning/afternoon/evening) |
| Weight Insight | Direction-based message (losing/gaining/maintaining) |
| Habit Suggestions | 3 default habits (water, no snacking, sleep) |

---

## MacroFactor-Style Adaptive TDEE System (January 2026)

### Overview

FitWiz now includes a sophisticated metabolic adaptation detection and algorithm-driven recommendation system, matching the industry-leading approach used by MacroFactor. This system provides:

- **EMA-smoothed weight trends** for noise reduction
- **TDEE with confidence intervals** (e.g., "2,150 ±120 cal")
- **Metabolic adaptation detection** (plateau + TDEE drop alerts)
- **Adherence tracking** with sustainability scores
- **Multi-option recommendations** (aggressive/moderate/conservative)

### How It Works

#### Weight Trend Smoothing (EMA)
```
Raw Weight Data:     85.2 → 86.0 → 84.8 → 85.5 → 84.9 → 85.1
                     (daily fluctuations from water, food, etc.)

EMA Smoothed:        85.2 → 85.32 → 85.24 → 85.28 → 85.22 → 85.20
                     (alpha = 0.15, filters noise)

Result: -0.02 kg net change (stable, not the wild swings raw data shows)
```

#### TDEE Calculation with Confidence
```
Energy Balance Equation:
TDEE = Calories In - (Weight Change × Caloric Content)

Where:
- Caloric Content = 75% fat (7700 kcal/kg) + 25% lean (1800 kcal/kg)
- Weight Change = EMA-smoothed end weight - EMA-smoothed start weight

Confidence Interval:
- Base uncertainty: ±300 cal
- Adjusted by data quality: more logs = tighter confidence
- Example: 2,150 ±120 cal (high data quality)
```

### User Flow

#### Weekly Check-In Trigger

```
1. USER OPENS NUTRITION SCREEN
   └─> System checks days since last check-in
   └─> If ≥7 days → Auto-prompt for weekly check-in

2. OR: MANUAL TRIGGER
   └─> Nutrition → Settings → "Run Weekly Check-In"
   └─> Nutrition → Action Menu → "Weekly Check-In"
```

### Adherence Calculation

Adherence is calculated per-macro with weighted importance:

| Macro | Weight | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Calories | 40% | Most important for weight goals |
| Protein | 35% | Critical for body composition |
| Carbs | 15% | Energy and performance |
| Fat | 10% | Hormone function and satiety |

```
Per-Macro Adherence:
- Within ±5% of target: 100% adherence
- Beyond tolerance: Linear decrease to 0% at 2x deviation

Overall Adherence = (Cal × 0.40) + (Pro × 0.35) + (Carb × 0.15) + (Fat × 0.10)
```

### Sustainability Score

Sustainability Score = (Adherence × 0.60) + (Consistency × 0.25) + (Logging × 0.15)

| Score | Rating | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| ≥0.70 | HIGH | User can maintain current targets long-term |
| 0.50-0.69 | MEDIUM | Some adjustments may help |
| <0.50 | LOW | Targets may be too aggressive |

### Metabolic Adaptation Detection

#### Plateau Detection
```
Trigger: <0.2 kg total change over 3+ weeks despite 300+ cal deficit

Action: Suggest diet break (1-2 weeks at maintenance)
```

#### TDEE Drop Detection
```
Moderate (10-15% drop): Suggest refeed days (2-3 high carb days)
Severe (15-20% drop): Suggest reducing deficit
Critical (>20% drop): Suggest diet break
```

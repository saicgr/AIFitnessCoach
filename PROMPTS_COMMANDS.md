Absolute piece of trash. Using coach I set my preferences and it totally ignored those. Then it wouldn't let me create a new plan because it showed I had already exercised today. Those few little baby exercises weren't enough and there's no way to do more under the same plan. It's much better to just use the Daily Strength app and put together your own plan.

Implement them all, implement frontend flutter, backend API, supabase tables, gemini API calls, backend tests, supabase table migration, user context logging should all be implemented as well and Update Features.md

Be sure to check that all items in your plans are implemented

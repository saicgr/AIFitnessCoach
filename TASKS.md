ASAP:
4. User asked for a quick workout but it only gave them big message but did't generate a workout RETEST
14. Challenges of the week. Can we do something where the user is allowed to put in a goal for the week like a push it to the limit to see how many push ups or another exercise they can do at the end of their workout week? This could be then recorded and something they can try to beat over time.
17. Add directly from library
20. On the rest screen do some kind of words of encouragement featuring the them of the AI coach.
25. Demo of the whole app
32. Make it easy to add supersets
37. Gemini 2.5 flash text to speech
38. Posture video review
39. The app overall is pretty good but I'm already sick of adjusting the weight values it's giving me. the AI doesn't understand what weight is possible with machines or dumbbells. It tells me to increase my bench press or curls by 2.5 pounds when you can't do less than 5 pound increments which is simply industry standard so it is pretty annoying.
40. If I could add new equipment that the app doesn't come with, 5 stars across the board. Warmups are another thing that really be addressed
41. it's a good app, but going up 10 or 15 pounds every week is not what I want I constantly have to make it to where I have a the same reps and weight for at least two weeks or a month. I hate how you can't pick cardio for one of your workouts. you have to manually add it. most apps you can include it. Doing 20 reps of something because you keep the same weight is crazy as well.
42. No option to change to a home gym and detail the equipment available. If it isn't a known commercial gym forget about it. The app won't save daily photos anymore. You can try taking the photo or selecting it from the gallery . it will let you crop it and it will put the gavel logo in the gym stats in front of it but there is no save button anymore. Also You will do leg workouts 5 days a week and you'll be lucky to hit arms, shoulders, chest, back or abs maybe once a week.
43. An otherwise excellent app, that seems to have often bizarre and contradictory support experiences. The lack of ability to create equipment yourself is odd -- and it does have coverage gaps if your gym uses Technogym, Hoist, or LifeFitness branded equipment. You are directed instead to reach out to support or post on reddit. Some support team members take the feedback, others give you responses like "just don't use that equipment" -- as if you can control equipment mix and availability.
44. 3 months into the app, after switching from a face-to-face PT. Although dubious to start with, this app has proven to surpass expectations. Super clear to follow, great workouts that change each time (but still in-line with my push, pull, legs cycle). Also love how it adjusts the weights mid set to maximise the workout. Thoroughly recommend.
45. I'd also like to see some widgets
46. One annoying bug I've encountered: after completing a workout, you can attach an image with the workout summary, similar to Strava. However, the 'Save' and 'Share' buttons don't work. Clicking them does nothing. The image won't save to the gallery or share to any platform I've tried (Messenger, Facebook, etc.).
47. The good: the app has a nice UX and is bug free. The bad: The “AI” constantly suggests new exercises with weird weights, even after I programmed in my own workouts so it could “learn” my strength level. The “consistent” setting, favoriting exercises, queuing exercises didn’t help - I had to customize around the AI’s suggestions so much, I turned it into a time consuming, paid version of the spreadsheet I was already using. I only wish I hadn’t paid for six months, this app is just not for me.
48. I hope they add more exercises especially unilateral and mobility exercises.
49. It keeps my workouts fresh by changing some of the exercises each week and they aren't disruptive changes, same muscle group different exercise. For me...definitely worth the subscription.
50. I've been using this for about 2 months now, and it works great. I love that I can modify the weights, reps, sets, and have it give me drop sets or supersets. it also has a great list of exercises that give instructions and videos of how to do the exercises. I do have a couple complaints, though. It will calculate your estimate 1RM, but I would like for it to give the option to work out at a percentage of your 1RM; so, if I only wanted to do 70% of my max, I'd like for it to let me.
51. Only one I could tell is that it doesn't allow you to make your own exercise; i.e. a combo dumbbell bench press & chest fly.
52. Suggest Recipes based on food, culture, body type and diet.

<!-- PRIORITY #1: Make AI Coach Actually Work Like a Coach
Now THAT'S a clear value prop. That changes everything.
Replacing Human Fitness Coaches with AI
What a human coach does:
Human Coach	Your AI Needs To Do
Creates personalized program	✅ AI workout generation
Adjusts based on feedback	❓ Does it adapt when user says "too hard"?
Checks in weekly	❓ Does AI proactively reach out?
Answers questions anytime	❓ AI chat working?
Tracks progress over time	❓ Does AI reference past workouts?
Holds you accountable	❓ Notifications, streaks?
Knows your injuries/limitations	✅ User profile
Motivates when you're slacking	❓ Re-engagement?
Why people PAY $100-300/month for coaches:
Accountability - Someone checking if you did the work
Personalization - Not a generic PDF plan
Adaptation - Plan changes based on progress/life
Access - Can ask questions anytime
Expertise - Knows what to do for YOUR goals
The Real Retention Question
Users come back to a human coach because:
They paid money (sunk cost)
Coach texts them "Did you workout today?"
Coach adjusts their plan when they plateau
They have a relationship
Your AI needs to replicate this relationship.
What Makes AI Coach Sticky (Not Trash Talk)
Feature	Why It Creates Retention
Proactive check-ins	AI messages YOU first: "How was yesterday's workout?"
Adaptive plans	AI notices you're struggling and adjusts
Progress tracking	"You've increased squat weight 20% in 6 weeks"
Memory	"Last time you said your knee hurt - how is it now?"
Accountability	"You missed Monday - want to reschedule?"
The Key Differentiator
Human coach: $200/month Your AI coach: $10/month (or free) Same personalization, same check-ins, same adaptation - 1/20th the price.
Question: Is your AI currently able to:
Remember past conversations and reference them?
Proactively message users (push notifications)?
Adapt workouts based on user feedback?
These are the core features that replace a human coach - not trash talk. -->

<!-- Can you delete data and uninstall and install flutter app? -->
<!-- compare and contrast web code to flutter code -->

<!-- startups that can combine tech innovation with strong fundamentals -->

<!-- Startups need to implement strong encryption, secure cloud infrastructure, and transparent privacy policies. Ensuring data privacy and security isn’t just a best practice – it’s often a deal-breaker issue for investors. As one developer guide notes, handling sensitive health metrics requires stringent protection and regulatory compliance from day one 
Also have to add saying 
"the app use AI, mistakes may occuer, T&C Apply"
"Have to ask user for user consent"? Have to decide on it
-->

<!-- Investors may ask if an app anonymizes user data, how it stores or shares data with third parties, and whether it has obtained necessary user consents. -->

<!-- An investor will scrutinize engagement metrics and tactics: Does the app use gamification (badges, challenges, leaderboards) to encourage regular use? Does it foster a community or accountability (friends, groups, or trainer interactions) to keep people hooked? Without compelling engagement hooks, even a great AI feature could fall flat. -->

<!-- investors need to be convinced that an AI fitness app’s cool features translate into genuine habit formation for users. Some mitigations they look for: evidence of a core group of power users (even if overall churn is high, having a loyal base is valuable), or unique content that competitors don’t have, or integration into user’s daily life (for example, connected to a wearable that they use constantly) -->

<!-- Investors are therefore concerned with how accurate, personalized, and effective the AI really is. -->

<!-- If an AI recommends an overly intense workout that causes injury, that’s a serious issue. So, reliability is a big question mark. -->

<!-- larger companies could incorporate similar AI features quickly – for instance, MyFitnessPal or Nike could roll out an AI coach update, instantly challenging a startup’s unique selling point. The presence of big players and copycats is a constant strategic risk. Differentiation is the keyword – without it, market saturation is a serious concern. -->

<!-- Investors worry about monetization metrics like ARPU and LTV in this sector. If an app spends, say, $30 in ads to acquire a user, but that user only subscribes for 3 months at $10/month, the math doesn’t work (CAC > LTV) -->

Data Work:
1. Generate images of workout programs
Generate an image prompt and an image rationale for a fitness app banner based on the archetype of [INSERT CHARACTER NAME HERE]. 
The prompt must fulfill the following strategic criteria:
	1.  **Safety & Legal Firewall:** Explicitly instruct the image generation to avoid all trademarked elements: no masks, no specific logos, no official armor/costume designs, and no character name in the final visual.
	2.  **Fitness Focus:** The subject must be a highly fit individual performing a strength, power, or functional training movement relevant to the character's archetype.
	3.  **Vibe Translation:** Use the character's core color palette (e.g., red/blue for Superman) and their defining physical traits (e.g., speed, strength, durability) to create the mood.
	4.  **Program Naming:** Create a safe, high-value program name (e.g., "The Velocity Protocol") and a fitness-focused tagline to be overlayed on the final image.
8. Data Import Export
9. Rest is defaulted to 90s need to change it
10. Planks and some wokrouts do not have sets and reps

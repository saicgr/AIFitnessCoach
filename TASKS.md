2. Thats a solid rep for the next o=workout can you try increasing the weight 10 more lbs?
3. Hi ! I suspect it's complicated and certainly not on the Roadmap but it would be huge if we had training adapted to the women's cycle. Related to Apple health for example. A woman having phases where performance will differ.

But you already do a crazy job and thank you for all that :)
If you’re not already, make sure you’re manually scheduling deload weeks around the start of your predicted periods. It would be super handy if the app automatically did it for you!

Oura ring integration?
4. So far the app reminds me of the OG Fitbod app, which was great. Using it while rehabbing a back and hip injury, and look forward to getting some more workouts from it.

A couple questions:

Is there a way to exclude all “jump” exercises;

For specifying my home equipment, I’ve got a squat rack with either a low or high cable option, but the app still recommends exercises for an adjustable cable, like one that can be moved to a center spot;

We might need a new colun saying is jump to like filter out jump exercises
5. Add variations for exercises, ex quad dominant bulgarian split squat vs glute
If you lean forward in the exercise you target your glutes more. Having this tracked in the app will show recovery status far more accurately.

It could also be a way to categorize exercises, you have the bss, then you can select the equipment like bands, dumbbells, smith machine, etc along with stance. It could all live under one exercise making the visual display simpler
6. Can we have a workout calendar like /Users/saichetangrandhe/AIFitnessCoach/image copy.png from gravl
7. Can we have strength history and strength per muscle like /Users/saichetangrandhe/AIFitnessCoach/image copy 2.png 
8. Recommendations for how I should use Gravl for hypertrophy
Would love recommendations for how to best use Gravl given my current practices and goals. Thanks for any tips.

Main goal: building my chest and shoulders, which I’ve indicated in Gravl as muscles to emphasize.

Currently:

- I work out 2-4x per week for 20-40 min.

- I have Gravl set to generate 40 min work outs on a P/P/L. So on some days I only get halfway through somewhat randomly.

Thinking about doing the following:

- 30 minimum upper body 2x during the week, 60min full body 1x during the weekend, so trying to hit chest/shoulders 3x weekly. (Don’t think Gravl has a way to specify a particular training volume, right?)

- Adjusting Gravl’s work outs manually so I start with Chest and shoulder exercises, in case I run out of time so I don’t end up not doing them.

- Marking as “favorite” dumbbell and barbell bench and incline press and flyes? Anything else?

- Setting Gravl to favor “more consistency” vs variety so I can track progress — or would variety be better for hypertrophy?

- Setting Gravl to 8-12 reps, 3-4 sets, and straight sets (not drop or pyramid).

What do you think? Thanks for any advice.
9. 
Hi! I'd love to see some options for digital resistance which allows us to track eccentric, chains mode etc

(for machine like gym monster etc)

thanks!
10. Really enjoying my experience with this app so far, I have a weight bench and some adjustable dumbbells up to 50 pounds each. Along with a few other things like resistance bands. I’m looking for a list of the best bang for buck equipment to have at a home gym that this app can utilize. I think one huge key selling point of gravl is it ability to create workouts with your own equipment, I’m just not sure what equipment is most recommended that it can utilize for the most variation of exercises. If it doesn’t exist, I think they should publish a list of recommended equipment somewhere.
11. I'd love to see the option for added weight like a weight belt or weighted vest as equipment for things like weighted dips and pull ups. I know I can add the weight manually but the app seems to ignore it overall.
12. Are there any plans to bring Gravl to Samsung/Galaxy watches (Wear OS)? It would be amazing to track workouts and rest timers directly from the watch instead of relying on the phone screen.

Also, I’ve noticed that if I switch away from the Gravl app on my phone (even briefly), the “break between sets” notification doesn’t go off. The timer runs, but the alert never pops unless the app stays open in the foreground.

Not sure if this is a known limitation or a bug, but wanted to flag it in case others are seeing the same thing.
13. Why isnt there a calf raise machine option?
14. Have you guys thought about adding predictions. Like based on your current level and how often/hard you train you should be here at point x in 3 months/6 months/ 1 year.
15. Please consider implementing a feature that allows data to be exported. It would be nice to view all data from exercises in a spreadsheet form. Seems to me this should be an easy addition to the app.
16. Hello. I am a recent gravl user.

I would like to put together a routine that combines one day of upper body training with dumbbells and another day of legs training with kettlebells. Is there a way to generate the routines automatically or do I have to manually add each one?
17. You could set one gym profile with just dumbbells and the other gym Profile with kettlebells then alternate when needed
18. Is it possible to import your workout into the Whoop strength trainer?
19. I am trying to create a lateral sled pull and push exercise but I can’t figure out how to recreate it with distance and weight like regular sled push?
Just seconding that I can’t figure it out either. Only option is distance, but doesn’t include weight.
20. Is there anyway to make Treadmill a default at the beginning of every workout? I do a 20 minute incline/decline before every workout to open myself up. Or rowing machine, and if can we add like incline value on threadmill?..and add the calorie count
21. can we add rings? and calisthenic workouts regarding those? Agreed. I use mine for ring dips, rows, pull-ups and pushups.
22. Double Exercises in a Custom Routine
Hi, it’s possible to allow the app to double exercises in a custom routine. Like I want to start with curls, do another exercise and return to another set of curls. I don’t see this possibility with the app right now. Nope, I’m talking about repeating same exercise in a different order from a custom workout.

I received a program that I added as custom to measure my progress in the app and I realized that I need as an example start my Quad routine with Leg Extensions and finish with more intensity with another set of Leg Extensions
23. So i literally just crossed the 1 million lbs volume. But i haven't gotten the badge for it. Can anyone explain to me as to why this is?
24. Hey u/juliang8, what about creating a “Wrapped 2025” like the trend with the amount of hours working out, top 5 exercises, volume, days working out, calories burned, etc. Just a thought to promote the app with our friends!
25. I’m fairly new to the app but haven’t figured out a way to move the timer. It’s hard to see if my phone is in a cup holder. Maybe give us an option in a future update to move it if it’s not possible? Thanks!
26. Hi all, I would like to know this. When I have the reverse pyramid enabled and I do 3 or 4 warmup sets, the last training set is the same as the third/fourth warmup set. Consequently, the last training set has lower reps than the first training set, when in reality it should have higher reps. This doesn't happen when I do 2 or 1 warmup sets.This problem also exists when selecting pyramid and same reps. I think it's a bug. Many thanks.
27. I am quite a fan of zerchers for a squat that doesn’t fatigue as much as traditional forms.

Could we maybe have them added?

(I suspect they maybe the next fashionable exercise as well… it’s been a while since they were fashionable and someone is bound to pick up on them for content soon) 
Zercher squats, zercher deadlifts, jefferson deadlifts, hack deadlifts

we need Bugenhagen dlc
28. I would love for their to be a leaderboard outside of the normal friends leaderboard just to see how I was doing in my work outs comparatively. Maybe an option to turn it on and off as well.
29. Hello devs,

I’m really liking the app so far, especially the variety of exercises. It keeps the workflow fresh.

However, the Strength Score for Barbell Row (and Barbell Reverse) seems wrong. The scaling doesn't match up with standard strength ratios or my other lifts. It feels like the range for these specific inputs needs an adjustment to be accurate. From what I saw online, it's currently very low for Olympic.
It's great, because I'm currently 100% filled on Olympic, but if I'm realistic that's seems unlikely :)
30. How can I track jacobs ladder on this app?
31. I take post-workout pictures in the app every session. I’m wanting to make one of those videos that flip through progress pictures. Any way to mass download photos?
32. One thing that I’ve noticed on switching from fitbod, I can’t “carry” my workout from the phone to my watch.

I have to start and continue the routine pushed to my watch, or my phone, but seemingly can’t bounce between the two? Logging will get out of sync, etc. Agreed. I have used other apps like heavy and the watch app is practially useless . I would love to see heart rate and a LOT more so I don’t need to go back to my phine
33. I have been lifting consistently for about 6 years now. I go 7 days a week, and I am pretty strict on that. My gym is open 24/7/365, and I am in there everyday. Christmas day, Thanksgiving, New Years, doesn't matter. I am in the gym. I have done a handful of workouts over the years, all the common ones. Starting strength, PPL, bro splits for the most part. For the longest, my routine has been chest, back, shoulders, legs, repeat. This app got recommended to me on Tiktok, so I gave it a try and have been using it for the last few weeks.

I do like the variation of workouts, and it really pulls me out of my comfort zone. I haven't ever done things like cable kick backs, hip abductor (birthing machine), Bulgarian split squats, leg raises, hip thrusts ect. The app has me trying new machines, and different ways of working out which has made working out exciting each time I get to the gym. Sure, it's probably not the most scientific routine for building muscle, but who really cares? It's about working hard, being consistent, and having fun doing it. I like how it pushes you to progress on each lift but not just the typical add 5lbs every week. Sometimes it adds reps, sometimes it adds another set, sometimes it adds weight, sometimes it adds a lot of weight and reduces volume. It's a great way to progress without actually feeling like you're progressing if that makes sense. The other thing that was a very big positive, and most wont even recognize this, but it pushes a lot of low back isolation workouts and that is HUGE for keeping a healthy low back. I have a terrible low back, mostly because I spent so much time doing starting strength and PPL routines that have ZERO low back isolation workouts. Those routines expect your back to stay healthy under load without ever doing any low back isolation workouts. I found the cure to my back pain was in back extensions and jefferson curls. I was pleased to see this app have back extensions, weighted back extension machine, and superman's almost every other day. That is very important to target and isolate your low back often to keep it strong for things like deadlifts, squats, and rows.

The only negative I can say is that the app has WAY too much volume for a natty lifter going 7 days a week. I told the app when I first signed up that I go 7 days, and the app recognized that 7 days is a lot and warned me of that, but didn't reduce any volume. There's been a couple days that I had to cut the workouts short as I was close to vomiting. The app probably works best for 3-4 days a week as is. I would like if the AI could tune for people who like to go to the gym every day, but don't want to die doing it.

Anyway, I purchased a year of the app and look forward to seeing how I progress over the next 12 months.
34. We might both progress differently but I generally workout with my sister, is there a way to sync the apps so we each do the same workout but log out different weights?

Yeah, I do this every week with my buddy.

Open the workout on your phone, then top right the 3 dots icon, “share”.

Will put up a QR code they can scan and it will open the same routine on their phone.

It also automatically changes the weights based on their profile.
35. Any plans on a family subscription? I would love to be able to track my son’s workouts in addition to mine.
36. I'm going on an 8 day cruise next month and would love to keep up with training using the ship's gym, but I'm not sure I can justify paying for the wifi package. Will Gravl still work at sea without internet access?

If not, what alternative do you suggest? If it makes a difference, I'll have access to mobile data for the first few hours after boarding before we depart to create a new gym profile etc.
To be honest, I've never tested for full 8 days. It's designed to work offline but we assume you'll be online at some point in between workouts. That said, I've done multiple workouts in a row in offline mode (as test) and they all synched fine. I'm also not sure what will happen with your subscription. If I have to say you there's probably 50% of it working.
37. Hi, does the AI-generated routine take into account the shoulder split, anterior, lateral, and posterior deltoids, or does it consider the shoulder as a single muscle? And then I would like to know if a periodization is implemented in the algorithm. Thank you

If you check the recovery section, you can check the estimated fatigue in each section of the shoulder. So yeah, it tracks each one separately.

I haven't used it long enough or deep enough to answer thr second part of your question.
38. Garmin Support
39. Big fan! Two things that are must haves:

Break down all muscles like shoulders: biceps - long head short head etc Triceps - long medial short Chest - upper lower mid

Secondly; My gym has pre weighted easy bars - AI doesn’t have the right stuff to progressively up the weights. Would love to have all weights have options like 10,20,30,40,50lb easy bars and pre set machine numbers for customization.

Keep it up team!!!
40. Have enjoyed it for a while but I think after I switched to a strength low rep program I got a forearm injury. Not gravls fault my wrist stabilizers have been underdeveloped and it was a weak spot. But now that I’m back I have two questions

Can you support user designed workout days with specific workouts and

Can you make it configurable to choose the specific increments of progress (i.e. if you have 3+ RIR in one day you had chest press, limiting the increase in weight/reps to something like 0.25% or .5% increase)
41. Hello, I created a favorite exercise for my abs. I put 6 exercises in superset. I would like to be able to repeat the superset 4 times, is this possible (if possible with a 1 minute break between each)? Because at the moment I feel like I have to create this one 4 times. THANKS
42. Question I know that watchos app is in continuous development however a few questions:

Can you replace an exercise from watch?

If I update on phone during a workout ho do I refresh phone since I need to end workout on watch I hear

If I end on phone it doesn't end the watch workout causing inconsistencies.

I did try reading other posts but conflicting Info.

Thank you!
43. Is there any way to get my body fat percentages to sync to the gravel app? I have a Hume body pod that syncs to my Apple health app but would be sweet if all the metrics in my health could sync to gravl for a better overall picture of progress.. also if workouts in the Apple fitness would show up as well. If anyone knows of a way besides the entering it everyday it would be greatly appreciated:)
44. I'm looking to complete a Hyrox race next year and wondered if there would be anything in Gravl that could push me in the right direction.

I currently use Runna for run training plans and am training for a marathon so have the running part down with no issues.

I also don't have a Hyrox specific gym nearby so can't do all the specific stations at the moment.
45. I’m no Hyrox expert, but running is by far the most important part of a Hyrox. A good runner will always beat someone who’s just strong or does lots of HIIT workouts. So in that sense, you’re already in a great spot.

After your marathon, I’d say follow a 10 K-focused running program or I'm pretty sure they even have a Hyrox one but it'll be basically the same thing.

In terms of gym work, I would keep it to 2 sessions per week if you just want to maximize hyrox performance. And maybe practice a little techinique for things like rowing and skiing, although they're not rocket science.

We don’t have a specific Hyrox program in Gravl, mainly because we don’t yet have the built-in capacity to recommend runs, and even the HIIT workouts would need to be structured a bit differently to fully match Hyrox training.

But again, running is 80% of a Hyrox training plan.
46. First off let me say THANK YOU to the devs for adding Strava integration to Gravl! The best part about this app is that you guys listen to your users and are constantly making the user experience better. Now, I fully recognize and own that this request is petty and nitpicky... but could we add additional detail and better looking content to the Strava Upload?

A couple of examples: When you upload a workout to Strava it just says "GRAVL - Full Body" It would be nice if the upload labeled the workout the same as it does in the app - listing out the muscles worked as the title. It would also be cool if it showed the muscle diagrams of those muscle groups. Lastly I've noticed that the workout details don't include the Kcal data, would be nice to include that.

I came from Fitbod (and I'll never look back...you guys truly make a superior product imo), but I did love the content they included in the Strava upload.

Again, I know this request is getting into the weeds a bit. But thought I'd ask. Thank you for all you guys do!
47. I can't effectively connect my Samsung health app. It says its connected but nothing i do in gravl ever shows up there and vice versa
48. Add a video option for the work out summary post at the end! It would be cool to share a video of a set from the work out.

Similar to how exercises show what muscle group is being worked, I'd like to see that for the warm up and stretching.
49. I think it would be a good idea to add alternative widgets. On iOS at least, the only widgets I have access to are about my strength score, but truthfully I don’t care about that number at all.

Could we get widgets that show different info? Maybe upcoming workout(s), muscle recovery, or even maybe the calendar with blue squares that shows what days you’ve worked out over the last month or two
50. Maybe I'm asking too much, but is it possible to add a feature so that the additional workouts I log (such as forearms, core, or cardio) are not counted toward my weekly goal?
51. SPLIT SCREEN











<!-- OTHER APP REVIEWS -->
1. No customized meals available
2. I've been using Reshape for a while now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my journey towards a healthier lifestyle. One of the standout features for me is the seamless meal tracking. With just a single click, I can effortlessly add my meals using snap or voice input. This not only saves me time but also makes the process incredibly convenient. The AI is remarkably precise and apt, accurately identifying the nutritional content of my meals and providing insightful suggestions.
3. Very effective in tracking Indian meals. Plus excellent integration with my Samsung Watch.
4. Great concept, would definitely use it if it syncs with myfitnesspal. The hints you give it are although almost never processed, so needs work there.
5. Great application for tracking calories, it's very easy and simple compared to the application which I used previously. It would be better if could track the workout like how we do it in the heavy app, like a daily basis tracking. Apart from that it's a great app for tracking calories.
6. It's not give when capture its not recognised food and asking for describe them why they make advertisement like this
7. Its a good app to calculate the intake of protein calories etc but after the update the Ai won't recognize the image and it takes so much time to recognize.
8. Unable to get past the name, birthdate, and biological sex screen. Hitting "next" doesn't move me through the registration process at all. There's no change in the screen.
9. Please add barcode scanner feature too. It is not available even in premium subscription.
10. Amazing app 10/10 great how you can track vitamins and minerals although some foods do not count, shows cognition health, bone health ect. Premium is well worth it okay price, only thing I want to see is the vitamins and mineral tracking improve eg copper and iodine I'm having trouble tracking. Would also like to see a way to manually add vitamins and minerals eg from supplements or to manually adjust the vitamins in a food.


<!-- startups that can combine tech innovation with strong fundamentals -->

<!-- Startups need to implement strong encryption, secure cloud infrastructure, and transparent privacy policies. Ensuring data privacy and security isn’t just a best practice – it’s often a deal-breaker issue for investors. As one developer guide notes, handling sensitive health metrics requires stringent protection and regulatory compliance from day one 
Also have to add saying 
"the app use AI, mistakes may occuer, T&C Apply"
"Have to ask user for user consent"? Have to decide on it
-->

<!-- Investors may ask if an app anonymizes user data, how it stores or shares data with third parties, and whether it has obtained necessary user consents. -->

<!-- An investor will scrutinize engagement metrics and tactics: Does the app use gamification (badges, challenges, leaderboards) to encourage regular use? Does it foster a community or accountability (friends, groups, or trainer interactions) to keep people hooked? Without compelling engagement hooks, even a great AI feature could fall flat. -->

<!-- investors need to be convinced that an AI fitness app’s cool features translate into genuine habit formation for users. Some mitigations they look for: evidence of a core group of power users (even if overall churn is high, having a loyal base is valuable), or unique content that competitors don’t have, or integration into user’s daily life (for example, connected to a wearable that they use constantly) -->

<!-- Investors are therefore concerned with how accurate, personalized, and effective the AI really is. -->

<!-- If an AI recommends an overly intense workout that causes injury, that’s a serious issue. So, reliability is a big question mark. -->

<!-- larger companies could incorporate similar AI features quickly – for instance, MyFitnessPal or Nike could roll out an AI coach update, instantly challenging a startup’s unique selling point. The presence of big players and copycats is a constant strategic risk. Differentiation is the keyword – without it, market saturation is a serious concern. -->

<!-- Investors worry about monetization metrics like ARPU and LTV in this sector. If an app spends, say, $30 in ads to acquire a user, but that user only subscribes for 3 months at $10/month, the math doesn’t work (CAC > LTV) -->

Data Work:
1. Generate images of workout programs
Generate an image prompt and an image rationale for a fitness app banner based on the archetype of [INSERT CHARACTER NAME HERE]. 
The prompt must fulfill the following strategic criteria:
	1.  **Safety & Legal Firewall:** Explicitly instruct the image generation to avoid all trademarked elements: no masks, no specific logos, no official armor/costume designs, and no character name in the final visual.
	2.  **Fitness Focus:** The subject must be a highly fit individual performing a strength, power, or functional training movement relevant to the character's archetype.
	3.  **Vibe Translation:** Use the character's core color palette (e.g., red/blue for Superman) and their defining physical traits (e.g., speed, strength, durability) to create the mood.
	4.  **Program Naming:** Create a safe, high-value program name (e.g., "The Velocity Protocol") and a fitness-focused tagline to be overlayed on the final image.

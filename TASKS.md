  1. I want to be as comfortable as just uploading the images and ask waht do to eat easy easy it 
  must understand context and more as well.                                                         
  2. simply Upload screenshots from myftinesspal or similar to the AI caht, it will understand    
  context of the image and save to the food logger including database and the current nuturtion UI  
  and home screen widgets should also reflect that. It must give opinions based on what needs to    
  change and rate etc also just like analyze with AI in food logger                                 
  3. Form videos to prevent injuries                                                                
  4. make some changes to workout, exercise suggestions, add or delete ir replace exercise          
  5. app absed actions like I will ask to change app to dark mode and more then it should do that etc etc.  like asking to change to dark mode should switch app to use dark modoe etc think of more scenarios
  
  Do you think it is at a state where it can handle all this perfectly? Think of more ways a user can interact with their real life personal coach, that can be added to the AI Coach.

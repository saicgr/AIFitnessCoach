<!-- For other app another user said "3 months into the app, after switching from a face-to-face PT. Although dubious to start with, this app has proven to surpass expectations. Super clear to follow, great workouts that change each time (but still in-line with my push, pull, legs cycle). Also love how it adjusts the weights mid set to maximise the workout. Thoroughly recommend." Compare and contrast every part of the review with this flutter app and see waht needs improved and implemented.

Implement them all, implement frontend flutter, backend API, supabase tables, gemini API calls, backend tests, supabase table migration should all be implemented as well and Update Features.md

FUTURE in voting:
1. Posture video review
2. Casting to TV

ASAP:
4. User asked for a quick workout but it only gave them big message but did't generate a workout RETEST
14. Challenges of the week. Can we do something where the user is allowed to put in a goal for the week like a push it to the limit to see how many push ups or another exercise they can do at the end of their workout week? This could be then recorded and something they can try to beat over time.
17. Add directly from library
20. On the rest screen do some kind of words of encouragement featuring the them of the AI coach.
25. Demo of the whole app
32. Make it easy to add supersets
37. Gemini 2.5 flash text to speech for video audio AI generated --maybe just start and end audio
51. Only one I could tell is that it doesn't allow you to make your own exercise; i.e. a combo dumbbell bench press & chest fly.
52. Suggest Recipes based on food, culture, body type and diet.
53. Add mood based workout - like might have to add how does your mood feel today and the user selects and option and then a pop up would show up do you want to work it out, like if the user is angry, then it would generate a workout for anger etc.
53.1. Absolute piece of trash. Using coach I set my preferences and it totally ignored those. Then it wouldn't let me create a new plan because it showed I had already exercised today. Those few little baby exercises weren't enough and there's no way to do more under the same plan. It's much better to just use the Daily Strength app and put together your own plan.
53.2. I love this app! I have used it for two years now. However, I noticed the app no longer shows my improvements or setbacks in my personal best sessions :( It's only showing my new PB. It used to show the reductions or increases in time, both for each exercise and the workout. My app is up to date. Please bring that feature back! it is truly insightful and motivating!
53.3. Your UI used to be the best, but for some reason you've focused on all the social nonsense rather than just polishing the UI and adding obvious features. Pausing timed exercises? No way. Nice exercise video download flow? Who cares. But a full screen bloated with social features and random workouts instead of a simple "what's the next step on my journey" UI
53.4. There is no option for substitute if you can not do workouts bc of knee problem.. i can not do squats and lungies but there is no option to tell that or get a supstitute exercise. IMPORTANT
53.5. Lack of proper workout plans for full gym equipment. Even when you change the targeted muscle group, the warm-up exercises stay exactly the same. The coach also doesn't adjust the plan based on the actual weights I'm using. Overall, it feels like a waste of money. I'd like to request a refund, but there's no option to do that.
53.6. Would not recommend. When I wanted to extend my subscription, they tried to automatically put me in a more expensive tier. When I contacted support, I just got a generic reply that didn't even address my concern. Very shady business. Canceled now.
53.7. 1. Two runs (a 5K and 8K) instructed by the coach, completed. However the app got stuck at the run in progress screen, and the only way to end the run is by cancelling the completed run. So I lost two run statistics. This is a very critical bug for me. I noticed there was a new update to the app, After my next run next week, I'll remove this issue if it's fixed. 2. The app should provide a 5-10 secs transition between workout. It does not affect the rep-based workouts. However for time-based workout, the next workout will lose those seconds due to the switch where I will need to pickup the phone and see what the next workout actually is. As a bonus, if you can have the app speak out the name of the next workout, that will save the seconds that we need to look at the phone. 3. I completed this week's coach session. I intended to increase the number of days and available workout tools for next week. Either the app didn't provide me the ability to do that, or I simply overlooked that ability before starting the next week. The app should provide another function to just reset the week's settings.
53.8. Great app, easy to use. A good range of courses to pick from with a large workout library. I love that a workout is planned for me and adjusts with my fitness level and preferences. I'm really enjoying the explosive calisthenics plan with some skill progressions selected. The app has helped me develop from regular pushups to one arm pushups. Only thing I could ask for would be extra advanced skill progressions like dragon squats, hand stand pushups etc.
53.9. There's no way to trial the app first before subscribing. I saw there was a current subscription sale but the info in the store didn't say how much so I had to download to get information and you can't open or use the app without creating an account and subscribing. I'm not going to pay $60-75 for an app that could be rubbish as far as I know. I'm also annoyed that I had to give out my email and I can't find anywhere yet to unsubscribe from that.
53.10. Quitting after 2.5 years of its mostly incremental workouts; too sadistic if you've taken a break. Never boring, I used 'runs' to record speedwalking, and 15 min series for aerobics using legs and core. Several times I got sore when restarting, but this was the worst- after 5 weeks of break I chose 'easier' workout. It gave me 'aura' with 90 squats and added 24 lunges with little upper body. I did half the squats but at 70 yo limped for a week. I'm done. Great potential, cruel to non-athletes.
53.11. Overall a great app that keeps me on my toes with new routines. I'm giving 3 stars because the GPS for run based exercises isn't reliable. I'm unsure if this is because I live in Canada and I think the app is based in Europe. Ill happily change ny review to 5 stars once the GPS issues are fixed.
53.12. The 'coach' which is astonishingly overpriced will give you contortionist levels of excersises, warm ups that take half an hour and leave you feel like you've done no real training at all almost every time..... there's much better apps out there for the casual person. Also worth noting that the app is very badly designed, with unclear segments, confusing user interactions, inability to feedback or skip exercises to help teach 'coach' on a proactive basis and a complete lack of voice guidance.
53.13. you should start to think about your user flexibility and heart endurance before you telling them what to do. and your ai inconsistent also super stupid.
53.14. Pretty much garbage. The "coach" part - let's face it, the only real reason to get one of these apps and not Youtube - just randomly assigns the same 15 exercises regardless of how much equipment you have at home or difficulty feedback. Warm up is ALWAYS the same, regardless of muscle group you're focusing on. Oh, you want to select a muscle group? Push day? Leg day? Too bad. Do the same 15 as usual, double time. Sucks. Can't even edit a single exercise out of a predetermined coach routine.
53.15. it's a great app, I would say it can be a little annoying if for example you integrate something else like calisthenics at the start of your workout, ypu then get to a set and cant adjust the amount of sets ypu do, only the reps and weight, sometimes I have nothing left to give and end up trying to complete 5 sets and do not get the best form, psychologically I want to complete the whole thing but it would be nice if you could adjust the amount of sets.
53.16. I like the app so far but it would be great if I had the option to change the workout while I'm in it for example it told me to do 50 crunches and 10 mountain climbers, I could only do 30 crunches but there was no option to input this anywhere so now it says I did 50 crunches when I didn't it would be great if I could do this so I have an accurate tracker I've only been using it for 2 days so far but I like it and as a beginner to working out it's really helpful
53.17. strenght journeys are still too focussed on high repetitions rather then progressions and leverage. When an exercise is too easy the app just adds repetitions which makes workouts really boring. It takes really long for it to introduce pullups in a workout despite i can do them and then introduces high rep muscleups without progression or begin with low rep range. Exercises and repetitions are repetative and boring.
53.18. Great app, lots of variety in the workouts. You can tell it what equipment you have in your home gym and the AI will generate workouts based on that. I wish there were more CrossFit like equipment options like sandbags, medicine balls, slam balls, battle ropes etc. There also isn't an option to annotate that a run was done on a treadmill. Cardio days should have an option to select indoor/outdoor and automatically adjust for whatever is selected. This is a good app, with room to improve.
53.19. good app overall but needs to give more control over sets and reps. often adds in a workout of 6 sets of 30+ reps which is way too many. It's totally out of progression with what I have been doing, its boring as hell and I can't do it. Also doesn't seem to know what some exercises involve such as considering dumbbell squat thrusters which include shoulders, to be the same as dumbbell squats.
53.20. While running, gps never functions properly. When garmin is at 2km, freeletics says 5km 🤦🏻‍♀️ also, warmups and cooldowns are so weak now. it used to be very good but now it is inefficient.
53.21. One of those apps where you answer a bunch of questions to get a "tailored plan", but then hit a paywall to even see how the app works, let alone what your plan might look like. Seriously, a one week trial would not kill your profits, folks.
53.22. the fact that Spotify stops every 30 seconds while using the app now makes it a 1 star for me. It used to be a good app, but now it's broken.
53.23. Improvements needed: 1. warm-ups should have static holds early, not intermixed with kinetic moves, I'm trying to gradually increase my heart rate through movement, not stay stock still. 2. intervals shouldn't have any static holds. It's dangerous for your heart to go from burpee box jumps to planks. 3. Please let me change excercises in a workout at my discretion. 4. Let me pause workout without quiting. 5. countdown timer sux plus cheesy applause smh. sounds should be customizable.
53.24. You can only choose a maximum of five days per week for exercise. Anything more than that requires changing the settings repeatedly. What a terrible UX!!
53.25. Have to go through the sign up process and create an account before they hit you with the subscription screen. no where in the app store does it mention that the app is subscription only.
53.26. Definitely not for beginners, even though it’s advertised as suitable for all fitness levels. The problem isn’t the number of reps—it’s the exercises themselves, which are way too difficult for someone who’s never trained before. Sure, you can skip a few of the hardest ones, but only three. Changing settings or recreating workouts doesn’t lower the difficulty at all. If you’re a complete beginner like me, it’s absolutely useless—don’t waste your money.
53.27. it is not free. After giving all the personal information, it requires subscription to see the personal plan. I uninstalled.
53.28. The app is very good for creating structured workout plans using all the available equipment. Missing features: * There is no option to extract workout logs in a text format. * The navigation is not so good (multiple clicks can be reduced to single click at number of places) The way images show up is also not smooth, one needs to click 2-3 times.
53.29. Great workouts that are already planned for you so you can just exercise without thinking of what to do. You can see and feel results if you stay consistent.
53.30. This app is abysmal for anybody that has any real training experience. Despite containing a lot of exercises, it doesn't let you create and update your own custom workouts. It forces you to use their own programs, which is brain dead if you are anything but a complete beginner. Despite being a workout app, it doesn't let you set more than 5 days of training per week, so my six day split can say bye. Let's be honest, this app is made for people who don't really know anything about fitness.
53.31. I've been lifetime member since I really like app and I love the Ultimate Strength program. I would love it if it supports split screens so i could also play music apps. I would also love if app has a voice over explaining how to do the exercises and also prompt you of the next exercise..
53.32. Their class modules, ability to filter for the intensity and equipments you have, and the trainers pushing you to give your best are unparalleled compared to other competitors. All this without any ads and paywalls !
53.33. Really amazing app, just as easy to use. All the required workouts are there, from beginner to hardcore. It works for a fuss free guide, and best part being no ads, no clumsy interface.
53.34. I love all the classes offered. My only gripe is once you finish a class, it doesn't show calories burned and I need that so I can input into another app.
54. Test and check for offline mode
55. Finish Senior Mode
55.5. older person. trying to get moving. it has been helpful. however I progressed too quickly with the running and strained my calf. I should of made the AI make the running more gradual. having said that I've trained with an adapted program removing lower leg activities.
55.5 Offline mode aka Tracker Only Mode
56. Premium Subscriptionwork
56. Strength Score and integration to social
56.1. Need a FULL PLAN using all strength, nutrition, fasting in mind - can talk more.
57. Nutrition below:
57.1 I really like the app & think I've finally started reaching my goals thanks to it. Sometimes I wonder if adding data that takes into account fasting? Marking days that you fast & continue to weigh yourself... if & how that impacts your goals.
57.2 I would love to track my insulin and blood sugars with this using health connect. Type 1 Diabetic.
57.3 Okay app that allows you to track your macros as intended. But falls short for its library and ability to input cooked grains. It feels like I'm constantly having to add to it and after paying a premium of $80 it's not worth it especially when other apps have a larger data base and options while also trackin macros and cost way less annually. Also has issues when using the scan feature (ex. Scans well known drink, "Item not found"), I manually search for it and it's the first thing that pops up.
57.4 Initially enjoyed the polish of this, but I regret paying for Pro. It's too slow and too convoluted to track meals, which is the whole point of the app. We need a way to disable the useless (and incorrect) AI food tips after each meal logged, at least. Between that, the lag when searching for foods, and the various submenus for foods/meals/recipes, it's too much. Even saving common foods as a meal and selecting that every morning feels slower than other apps because of the tracker layout.
58. For analytics do we have workout bistory per exercise and also per muscle, not sure what the image is sowing like muscle or soemthing else.
59. Research on improving NEAT for a user.

<!-- PRIORITY #1: Make AI Coach Actually Work Like a Coach
Now THAT'S a clear value prop. That changes everything.
Replacing Human Fitness Coaches with AI
What a human coach does:
Human Coach	Your AI Needs To Do
Creates personalized program	✅ AI workout generation
Adjusts based on feedback	❓ Does it adapt when user says "too hard"?
Checks in weekly	❓ Does AI proactively reach out?
Answers questions anytime	❓ AI chat working?
Tracks progress over time	❓ Does AI reference past workouts?
Holds you accountable	❓ Notifications, streaks?
Knows your injuries/limitations	✅ User profile
Motivates when you're slacking	❓ Re-engagement?
Why people PAY $100-300/month for coaches:
Accountability - Someone checking if you did the work
Personalization - Not a generic PDF plan
Adaptation - Plan changes based on progress/life
Access - Can ask questions anytime
Expertise - Knows what to do for YOUR goals
The Real Retention Question
Users come back to a human coach because:
They paid money (sunk cost)
Coach texts them "Did you workout today?"
Coach adjusts their plan when they plateau
They have a relationship
Your AI needs to replicate this relationship.
What Makes AI Coach Sticky (Not Trash Talk)
Feature	Why It Creates Retention
Proactive check-ins	AI messages YOU first: "How was yesterday's workout?"
Adaptive plans	AI notices you're struggling and adjusts
Progress tracking	"You've increased squat weight 20% in 6 weeks"
Memory	"Last time you said your knee hurt - how is it now?"
Accountability	"You missed Monday - want to reschedule?"
The Key Differentiator
Human coach: $200/month Your AI coach: $10/month (or free) Same personalization, same check-ins, same adaptation - 1/20th the price.
Question: Is your AI currently able to:
Remember past conversations and reference them?
Proactively message users (push notifications)?
Adapt workouts based on user feedback?
These are the core features that replace a human coach - not trash talk. -->

<!-- Can you delete data and uninstall and install flutter app? -->
<!-- compare and contrast web code to flutter code -->

<!-- startups that can combine tech innovation with strong fundamentals -->

<!-- Startups need to implement strong encryption, secure cloud infrastructure, and transparent privacy policies. Ensuring data privacy and security isn’t just a best practice – it’s often a deal-breaker issue for investors. As one developer guide notes, handling sensitive health metrics requires stringent protection and regulatory compliance from day one 
Also have to add saying 
"the app use AI, mistakes may occuer, T&C Apply"
"Have to ask user for user consent"? Have to decide on it
-->

<!-- Investors may ask if an app anonymizes user data, how it stores or shares data with third parties, and whether it has obtained necessary user consents. -->

<!-- An investor will scrutinize engagement metrics and tactics: Does the app use gamification (badges, challenges, leaderboards) to encourage regular use? Does it foster a community or accountability (friends, groups, or trainer interactions) to keep people hooked? Without compelling engagement hooks, even a great AI feature could fall flat. -->

<!-- investors need to be convinced that an AI fitness app’s cool features translate into genuine habit formation for users. Some mitigations they look for: evidence of a core group of power users (even if overall churn is high, having a loyal base is valuable), or unique content that competitors don’t have, or integration into user’s daily life (for example, connected to a wearable that they use constantly) -->

<!-- Investors are therefore concerned with how accurate, personalized, and effective the AI really is. -->

<!-- If an AI recommends an overly intense workout that causes injury, that’s a serious issue. So, reliability is a big question mark. -->

<!-- larger companies could incorporate similar AI features quickly – for instance, MyFitnessPal or Nike could roll out an AI coach update, instantly challenging a startup’s unique selling point. The presence of big players and copycats is a constant strategic risk. Differentiation is the keyword – without it, market saturation is a serious concern. -->

<!-- Investors worry about monetization metrics like ARPU and LTV in this sector. If an app spends, say, $30 in ads to acquire a user, but that user only subscribes for 3 months at $10/month, the math doesn’t work (CAC > LTV) -->

Data Work:
1. Generate images of workout programs
Generate an image prompt and an image rationale for a fitness app banner based on the archetype of [INSERT CHARACTER NAME HERE]. 
The prompt must fulfill the following strategic criteria:
	1.  **Safety & Legal Firewall:** Explicitly instruct the image generation to avoid all trademarked elements: no masks, no specific logos, no official armor/costume designs, and no character name in the final visual.
	2.  **Fitness Focus:** The subject must be a highly fit individual performing a strength, power, or functional training movement relevant to the character's archetype.
	3.  **Vibe Translation:** Use the character's core color palette (e.g., red/blue for Superman) and their defining physical traits (e.g., speed, strength, durability) to create the mood.
	4.  **Program Naming:** Create a safe, high-value program name (e.g., "The Velocity Protocol") and a fitness-focused tagline to be overlayed on the final image.
8. Data Import Export
9. Rest is defaulted to 90s need to change it
10. Planks and some wokrouts do not have sets and reps

The prompt must fulfill the following strategic criteria:
1.  **Safety & Legal Firewall:** Explicitly instruct the image generation to avoid all trademarked elements: no masks, no specific logos, no official armor/costume designs, and no character name in the final visual.
2.  **Fitness Focus:** The subject must be a highly fit individual performing a strength, power, or functional training movement relevant to the character's archetype.
3.  **Vibe Translation:** Use the character's core color palette (e.g., red/blue for Superman) and their defining physical traits (e.g., speed, strength, durability) to create the mood.
4.  **Program Naming:** Create a safe, high-value program name (e.g., "The Velocity Protocol") and a fitness-focused tagline to be overlayed on the final image.

The final response must include the detailed image prompt, the generated image, and the legal/strategic rationale for its safety.

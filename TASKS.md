ASAP:

9. Challenges when workout generates or during test
10. Align images to exercise texts
11. Kettlebells or dumbbell what if they only have one?
12. Swap exercise and regenrate broken
14. Challenges of the week. Can we do something where the user is allowed to put in a goal for the week like a push it to the limit to see how many push ups or another exercise they can do at the end of their workout week? This could be then recorded and something they can try to beat over time.
15. Chat prompt text doesn't work as expected

25. Demo of the whole app
26. Small game between sets (optional)
27. Dance session or something between sets that will help burn more calories
28. How Real AI Coach Notifications Would Work
In production, the AI Coach would send notifications automatically via:
Daily Scheduler (Guilt Notifications)
Backend endpoint: POST /notifications/scheduler/check-inactive-users
Should be called by a cron job at 6pm daily
Sends "guilt" messages if you miss workouts
Morning Scheduler (Workout Reminders)
Backend endpoint: POST /notifications/scheduler/send-workout-reminders
Should be called by a cron job at 8am daily
Reminds you about scheduled workouts
To make these automatic, you'd need to set up cron jobs on your hosting platform (Render cron, AWS CloudWatch Events, etc.) to call these endpoints daily. Would you like me to help you set up the cron jobs, or do you want to test the AI Coach notification button first?

<!-- PRIORITY #1: Make AI Coach Actually Work Like a Coach
Now THAT'S a clear value prop. That changes everything.
Replacing Human Fitness Coaches with AI
What a human coach does:
Human Coach	Your AI Needs To Do
Creates personalized program	✅ AI workout generation
Adjusts based on feedback	❓ Does it adapt when user says "too hard"?
Checks in weekly	❓ Does AI proactively reach out?
Answers questions anytime	❓ AI chat working?
Tracks progress over time	❓ Does AI reference past workouts?
Holds you accountable	❓ Notifications, streaks?
Knows your injuries/limitations	✅ User profile
Motivates when you're slacking	❓ Re-engagement?
Why people PAY $100-300/month for coaches:
Accountability - Someone checking if you did the work
Personalization - Not a generic PDF plan
Adaptation - Plan changes based on progress/life
Access - Can ask questions anytime
Expertise - Knows what to do for YOUR goals
The Real Retention Question
Users come back to a human coach because:
They paid money (sunk cost)
Coach texts them "Did you workout today?"
Coach adjusts their plan when they plateau
They have a relationship
Your AI needs to replicate this relationship.
What Makes AI Coach Sticky (Not Trash Talk)
Feature	Why It Creates Retention
Proactive check-ins	AI messages YOU first: "How was yesterday's workout?"
Adaptive plans	AI notices you're struggling and adjusts
Progress tracking	"You've increased squat weight 20% in 6 weeks"
Memory	"Last time you said your knee hurt - how is it now?"
Accountability	"You missed Monday - want to reschedule?"
The Key Differentiator
Human coach: $200/month Your AI coach: $10/month (or free) Same personalization, same check-ins, same adaptation - 1/20th the price.
Question: Is your AI currently able to:
Remember past conversations and reference them?
Proactively message users (push notifications)?
Adapt workouts based on user feedback?
These are the core features that replace a human coach - not trash talk. -->

<!-- Can you delete data and uninstall and install flutter app? -->
<!-- compare and contrast web code to flutter code -->

<!-- startups that can combine tech innovation with strong fundamentals -->

<!-- Startups need to implement strong encryption, secure cloud infrastructure, and transparent privacy policies. Ensuring data privacy and security isn’t just a best practice – it’s often a deal-breaker issue for investors. As one developer guide notes, handling sensitive health metrics requires stringent protection and regulatory compliance from day one 
Also have to add saying 
"the app use AI, mistakes may occuer, T&C Apply"
"Have to ask user for user consent"? Have to decide on it
-->

<!-- Investors may ask if an app anonymizes user data, how it stores or shares data with third parties, and whether it has obtained necessary user consents. -->

<!-- An investor will scrutinize engagement metrics and tactics: Does the app use gamification (badges, challenges, leaderboards) to encourage regular use? Does it foster a community or accountability (friends, groups, or trainer interactions) to keep people hooked? Without compelling engagement hooks, even a great AI feature could fall flat. -->

<!-- investors need to be convinced that an AI fitness app’s cool features translate into genuine habit formation for users. Some mitigations they look for: evidence of a core group of power users (even if overall churn is high, having a loyal base is valuable), or unique content that competitors don’t have, or integration into user’s daily life (for example, connected to a wearable that they use constantly) -->

<!-- Investors are therefore concerned with how accurate, personalized, and effective the AI really is. -->

<!-- If an AI recommends an overly intense workout that causes injury, that’s a serious issue. So, reliability is a big question mark. -->

<!-- larger companies could incorporate similar AI features quickly – for instance, MyFitnessPal or Nike could roll out an AI coach update, instantly challenging a startup’s unique selling point. The presence of big players and copycats is a constant strategic risk. Differentiation is the keyword – without it, market saturation is a serious concern. -->

<!-- Investors worry about monetization metrics like ARPU and LTV in this sector. If an app spends, say, $30 in ads to acquire a user, but that user only subscribes for 3 months at $10/month, the math doesn’t work (CAC > LTV) -->

Data Work:
1. Generate images of workout programs
Generate an image prompt and an image rationale for a fitness app banner based on the archetype of [INSERT CHARACTER NAME HERE]. 
The prompt must fulfill the following strategic criteria:
	1.  **Safety & Legal Firewall:** Explicitly instruct the image generation to avoid all trademarked elements: no masks, no specific logos, no official armor/costume designs, and no character name in the final visual.
	2.  **Fitness Focus:** The subject must be a highly fit individual performing a strength, power, or functional training movement relevant to the character's archetype.
	3.  **Vibe Translation:** Use the character's core color palette (e.g., red/blue for Superman) and their defining physical traits (e.g., speed, strength, durability) to create the mood.
	4.  **Program Naming:** Create a safe, high-value program name (e.g., "The Velocity Protocol") and a fitness-focused tagline to be overlayed on the final image.
8. Data Import Export
9. Rest is defaulted to 90s need to change it
10. Planks and some wokrouts do not have sets and reps

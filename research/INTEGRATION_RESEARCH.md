## Circadian Biology & Optimal Timing

### The Body's Natural Rhythms

Your body follows a 24-hour clock that affects everything from hormone levels to muscle performance. Understanding this is key to optimizing the workout-nutrition-fasting trinity.

**Morning (6-10 AM):**
- Cortisol peaks (natural wake-up hormone)
- Blood sugar regulation is most efficient
- Insulin sensitivity is highest
- Best time for eating larger meals (chrononutrition research)

**Late Afternoon (2-6 PM):**
- Core body temperature peaks
- Muscle strength is highest
- Reaction time is fastest
- Mitochondrial function peaks
- **Best time for high-intensity workouts**

**Evening (6-10 PM):**
- Melatonin begins rising
- Metabolism slows
- Late eating increases fat storage
- Exercise too close to bed can disrupt sleep

### Key Research Findings

> "Early time-restricted eating, where food intake is confined to the morning or early afternoon, offers significant benefits for weight control, glycemic regulation, lipid profiles, and mitochondrial efficiency, even in the absence of caloric restriction." - MDPI Nutrients 2025

**Practical Implications for FitWiz:**

| Scenario | Optimal Strategy |
|----------|------------------|
| Morning workout + 16:8 fast | Break fast with post-workout meal (protein + carbs) |
| Afternoon workout + 16:8 fast | Eat pre-workout meal at noon, workout at 3-4pm |
| Evening workout + 16:8 fast | Challenging - may need to adjust eating window |
| Rest day + fasting | Extend fast, eat in early-to-mid afternoon |

### Circadian Workout Scheduling Feature

FitWiz could suggest optimal workout times based on:
1. User's fasting schedule (eating window)
2. Workout type (high-intensity vs. low-intensity)
3. Wake/sleep times
4. Historical performance data by time of day

```
Example Smart Suggestion:

User Profile:
- 16:8 fast (eating window 11am-7pm)
- Scheduled: High-intensity leg day
- Typical wake: 6am, sleep: 10pm

Recommendation:
"Schedule your leg day for 3-5pm for optimal performance.
Your body temperature and strength peak in late afternoon,
and you'll have fuel from your 11am-1pm meals."

Alternative if morning preferred:
"If training at 7am (fasted), expect ~15% less max strength.
Consider eating at 10:30am post-workout for recovery,
or switch to lighter cardio in the morning."
```

## Pre-Workout Nutrition Science

### Timing Guidelines

| Time Before Workout | What to Eat |
|--------------------|-------------|
| 3-4 hours | Full meal: 3-4g/kg carbs + 15-20g protein + moderate fat |
| 1-2 hours | Small meal: 1g/kg carbs + 10-15g protein, low fat |
| 30-60 min | Light snack: 0.5g/kg carbs, minimal protein/fat |
| Fasted | Nothing - but post-workout nutrition becomes critical |

### Macronutrient Functions

**Carbohydrates:**
- Primary fuel for moderate-to-high intensity exercise
- Stored as glycogen in muscles and liver
- Glycogen depletion = fatigue, decreased performance
- 90-120 minutes of exercise can deplete stores

**Protein:**
- Not primary fuel during exercise
- Pre-workout protein helps blood sugar control
- Provides amino acids for reduced muscle breakdown
- 15-20g is sufficient pre-workout

**Fat:**
- Slows digestion (why low-fat pre-workout is recommended)
- Primary fuel only during very low intensity exercise
- Not needed immediately pre-workout

### Fasted Training Considerations

When a user trains in a fasted state, FitWiz should recognize:

1. **Glycogen Status:**
   - 12-16 hours fasted: ~50% glycogen remaining
   - 16-24 hours fasted: Significantly depleted
   - High-intensity work may suffer

2. **Hormonal State:**
   - Growth hormone elevated (good for fat burning)
   - Cortisol elevated (can be catabolic if prolonged)
   - Adrenaline elevated (may feel energized initially)

3. **Fat Oxidation:**
   - Enhanced during fasted low-intensity exercise
   - This is why fasted cardio is popular for fat loss

## Post-Workout Recovery Science

### The Recovery Timeline

| Time Post-Workout | What's Happening | Action Needed |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| 0-30 min | Cortisol elevated, glycogen synthase active | Protein + fast carbs if fasted |
| 30-60 min | Peak insulin sensitivity | Ideal full meal window |
| 1-2 hours | Elevated protein synthesis continues | Complete meal if not eaten |
| 2-24 hours | Muscle protein synthesis remains elevated | Regular protein intake |

### Fed vs. Fasted Post-Workout

**If you ate 2-4 hours before training:**
- The "anabolic window" is less critical
- Amino acids from pre-workout meal still available
- Can wait 1-2 hours for post-workout meal
- Research shows similar results regardless of immediate intake

**If you trained fasted:**
- Muscle protein breakdown is elevated
- Net protein balance is negative
- Immediate nutrition is MORE important
- "Switch from catabolic to anabolic state ASAP"

> "In the case of resistance training after an overnight fast, it would make sense to provide immediate nutritional intervention—ideally protein + carbohydrate—for promoting muscle protein synthesis and reducing proteolysis." - PMC Research

### Optimal Post-Workout Macros

**For Strength Training:**
- Protein: 20-40g (0.25-0.4g/kg body weight)
- Carbs: 2:1 to 3:1 ratio (carbs:protein)
- Example: 30g protein + 60-90g carbs

**For Endurance Training:**
- Higher carb priority for glycogen replenishment
- Carbs: 4:1 ratio (carbs:protein)
- Example: 30g protein + 120g carbs

**For Fat Loss Focus:**
- Moderate carbs to maintain deficit
- Higher protein for satiety
- Example: 40g protein + 30-50g carbs

### Recovery Urgency Calculator

FitWiz could calculate recovery urgency:

```python
def calculate_recovery_urgency(
    hours_fasted: float,
    workout_intensity: str,  # low, moderate, high
    workout_duration: int,   # minutes
    minutes_since_completion: int
) -> str:

    base_urgency = 0

    # Fasting factor
    if hours_fasted > 16:
        base_urgency += 40
    elif hours_fasted > 12:
        base_urgency += 25
    elif hours_fasted > 8:
        base_urgency += 10

    # Intensity factor
    if workout_intensity == "high":
        base_urgency += 30
    elif workout_intensity == "moderate":
        base_urgency += 15

    # Duration factor
    if workout_duration > 60:
        base_urgency += 20
    elif workout_duration > 30:
        base_urgency += 10

    # Time decay (urgency decreases as window passes)
    if minutes_since_completion > 60:
        base_urgency -= 15
    elif minutes_since_completion > 30:
        base_urgency -= 5

    # Determine urgency level
    if base_urgency >= 60:
        return "CRITICAL"  # Red - Eat NOW
    elif base_urgency >= 40:
        return "HIGH"      # Orange - Eat within 30 min
    elif base_urgency >= 20:
        return "MODERATE"  # Yellow - Eat within 1-2 hours
    else:
        return "LOW"       # Green - Normal eating okay
```

## Hydration & Performance

### Impact by Dehydration Level

| Body Weight Loss | Performance Impact |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 1% | Minimal - may not notice |
| 2% | Strength -2%, Power -3%, Endurance -10% |
| 3% | Significant impairment across all metrics |
| 4%+ | VO2max -16%, Endurance -52% in heat |

### Key Research Findings

> "Hypohydration consistently attenuates strength (by approximately 2%), power (by approximately 3%) and high-intensity endurance (by approximately 10%)." - Journal of Sports Medicine

### Workout Hydration Guidelines

**Before Workout:**
- 500ml water 2-3 hours before
- 250ml water 15-30 min before

**During Workout:**
- 150-350ml every 15-20 minutes
- More in heat or high intensity
- Electrolytes for sessions >60 minutes

**After Workout:**
- 150% of body weight lost
- ~600-720ml per pound lost
- Include sodium for retention

### Fasting + Hydration Considerations

During fasting, insulin drops → kidneys release more sodium and water

**Implications:**
1. Increased urination during fasting
2. Greater fluid and electrolyte needs
3. Fasted exercise = double dehydration risk
4. Electrolyte supplementation may be needed

## Fasting & Electrolytes

### Why Electrolytes Matter During Fasting

When insulin drops during fasting:
1. Kidneys release more sodium
2. Potassium follows sodium out
3. Magnesium depletes faster
4. Risk of muscle cramps, fatigue, headaches

### Recommended Daily Electrolytes During Extended Fasts

| Electrolyte | Daily Need | Signs of Deficiency |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| Sodium | 2000-3000mg | Headache, fatigue, dizziness |
| Potassium | 1000-3500mg | Muscle cramps, weakness |
| Magnesium | 300-400mg | Cramps, poor sleep, irritability |

### What Doesn't Break a Fast

- Plain water
- Black coffee
- Plain tea
- Electrolyte supplements (zero-calorie)
- Sparkling water
- Salt

### What DOES Break a Fast

- Protein powder (stimulates mTOR, insulin)
- BCAAs (amino acids trigger protein synthesis)
- Fruit juice
- Sweetened drinks
- Bone broth (technically has calories/protein)

### Fasting + Workout Electrolyte Strategy

```
Pre-Workout (Fasted):
- 500ml water with pinch of salt
- Optional: Magnesium supplement

During Workout (Fasted):
- Plain water for sessions <60 min
- Electrolyte drink for sessions >60 min

Post-Workout (Breaking Fast):
- Meal with natural electrolytes
- Foods high in potassium: banana, avocado
- Foods high in magnesium: spinach, nuts
```

### Electrolyte Tracking Feature

FitWiz could track electrolyte-containing foods and drinks:
- Water logged → prompt for "plain or with electrolytes?"
- Meal logged → extract electrolyte content from nutrition data
- Show daily electrolyte summary for fasting users
- Warn when low + fasted + workout planned

---

## Sleep & Recovery

### Sleep's Role in Muscle Recovery

**Deep Sleep (N3 Stage):**
- Growth hormone released (75% of daily GH)
- Muscle protein synthesis amplified
- Tissue repair accelerated
- Glycogen replenishment enhanced

**REM Sleep:**
- Neural pathway consolidation
- Motor skill memory (important for technique)
- Emotional regulation

### Impact of Poor Sleep on Training

| Sleep Deprivation | Effects |
|-------------------|---------|
| <6 hours | Testosterone drops 10-15%, injury risk +1.7x |
| <7 hours | Cortisol elevated, recovery impaired |
| Fragmented sleep | Protein synthesis pathways disrupted |
| Chronic poor sleep | Muscle mass loss, fat gain promoted |

### Research Findings

> "Among the hormonal changes from sleep deprivation, there is an increase in cortisol secretion and a reduction in testosterone and IGF-1, favoring a highly proteolytic environment." - PMC Sleep Research

> "In youth, ≤8 hours of sleep increases injury risk by 1.7 times." - Sports Medicine Review

### Sleep + Fasting Interactions

Interesting research finding:
- Early time-restricted eating (eating earlier in day) improves sleep
- Late eating disrupts circadian rhythms and sleep quality
- Extended fasting can initially disrupt sleep (adjust over time)

### Sleep-Aware Training Recommendations

```
Sleep Quality Assessment:

Last Night: 5.5 hours (Poor)
Sleep Score: 58/100

│                                            │
│ With only 5.5 hours of sleep:              │
│ • Testosterone is ~10% lower               │
│ • Reaction time is impaired                │
│ • Injury risk is elevated                  │
│                                            │
│ Recommendations:                           │
│ 1. Consider light/moderate intensity today │
│ 2. Prioritize sleep tonight (aim for 8h)   │
│ 3. Extra protein today for recovery        │
│ 4. Avoid training to failure               │
│                                            │

#### Code Implementation Location

In `workout_complete_screen.dart`, modify the `_submitFeedback()` method:

```dart
// BEFORE (line ~1165-1175):
Future<void> _submitFeedback() async {
  // ... save feedback logic ...

  if (mounted) {
    context.go('/home');  // ← Goes straight home
  }
}

// AFTER:
Future<void> _submitFeedback() async {
  // ... save feedback logic ...

  if (mounted) {
    // NEW: Show post-workout actions sheet first
    final action = await showModalBottomSheet<PostWorkoutAction>(
      context: context,
      isScrollControlled: true,
      builder: (context) => PostWorkoutActionsSheet(
        workoutId: widget.workoutId,
        workoutDuration: _workoutDuration,
        workoutIntensity: _calculateIntensity(),
      ),
    );

    // Handle the selected action
    if (action != null) {
      await _handlePostWorkoutAction(action);
    }

    // Then go home
    if (mounted) {
      context.go('/home');
    }
  }
}

## Viral Features Research: What Makes Fitness Apps Go Viral

Based on comprehensive market research, here are **viral-worthy features** that would unite workout + nutrition + fasting in ways NO other app does, creating a unique competitive moat for FitWiz.

### The Psychology Behind Viral Fitness Features

#### Why Apple Watch Activity Rings Went Viral

The Apple Watch Activity Rings are one of the most successful gamification implementations in fitness. Here's why they work:

| Principle | How It Works | FitWiz Opportunity |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Goal-Gradient Effect** | As rings fill up, motivation increases exponentially near completion | Perfect Day Ring with 4 pillars |
| **Dopamine Hits** | Constant stream of micro-rewards flood brain with dopamine | Achievement pop-ups, sound effects |
| **Simplicity** | Three goals, three colors, one obsession | One unified streak number |
| **Pervasive Gaming** | Game played everywhere, all the time, no "pause" | Always-on tracking across pillars |
| **Social Reinforcement** | Share achievements for external validation | Friend challenges, leaderboards |
| **Streaks** | "10 days in a row!" creates loss aversion | Perfect Day streak with fire emoji |

**Key Insight:** Apple didn't invent fitness tracking, but they made it *obsession-worthy*. FitWiz can do the same for the fasting + workout + nutrition trinity.

### Viral Feature Opportunities for FitWiz

Based on market research, these are **high-viral-potential features** that unite all three pillars:

### 🔥 Feature: "Fusion Score" - The One Number That Matters

**Concept:** A single 0-100 daily score that combines ALL pillars into one obsessive number.

**Why It's Viral:**
- Samsung Health's "Energy Score" creates morning ritual of checking
- Whoop's "Recovery Score" has 92% daily check rate
- TruthScore's "one truthful scorecard that can't be faked" concept
- Users can share ONE number instead of explaining complex data

**How It Works:**
```
FUSION SCORE (0-100) = Weighted combination of:

## Additional Viral Features Research (Extended)

### The Psychology of Streaks: Deep Dive

**Why Streaks Work (The Science):**

Research shows streaks tap into fundamental psychological mechanisms:

1. **Loss Aversion** - Losing a 30-day streak feels 2.5x worse than gaining a new one
2. **Sunk Cost Fallacy** - "I can't break it now, I've invested so much"
3. **Identity Formation** - "I'm a person who works out every day"
4. **Variable Reward** - Uncertainty of whether you'll maintain creates dopamine

**The Hook Model Applied to FitWiz:**
```
TRIGGER → ACTION → VARIABLE REWARD → INVESTMENT
   ↓         ↓           ↓              ↓
Morning   Complete    Fusion Score   Share result
 push    all pillars  (varies daily)  on social
```

**Streak Success Stats:**
- Apple Watch activity rings: **80% of users** engage with streak features
- Duolingo: Streaks increased retention by **4.3x**
- Snapchat: Streaks responsible for **30% of daily opens**

**The Gentler Streak Approach:**
Traditional streaks create anxiety. Modern apps use "streak shields" and "freeze days":
- Allow 1 miss per week without breaking streak
- "Grace period" for illness or travel
- "Partial credit" for 3/4 pillars completed

**FitWiz Streak Innovation - "Flex Streaks":**

protein at 1100 hours. THEN we destroy those legs. DO
YOU UNDERSTAND?"

- Motivational audio at key moments

**Use Cases:**
```
During Workout:
User: "Hey FitWiz, I'm struggling"
AI: "You've got 2 sets left. Remember your PR is 185 and
     you're at 175. You're stronger than this weight."

Logging:
User: "Log my deadlift, 315 for 5"
AI: "Got it - 315 pounds, 5 reps. That's a new rep PR at
     this weight! Only 2 exercises left."

Questions:
User: "Should I do cardio after this?"
AI: "You're 14 hours fasted. I'd recommend eating first.
     Your eating window opens in 30 minutes."
```

**Unique FitWiz Advantage:**
Voice commands work across ALL pillars:
- "Start my fast" → Begins fasting timer

- "How much water today?" → Reports hydration status
- "What's my Fusion Score?" → Reads current score

### Feature 15: Predictive Streak Protection

**What It Is:**
AI predicts when you're likely to break your streak and intervenes BEFORE it happens.

**Why It's Viral:**

Preventing streak breaks creates:
- Emotional relief ("FitWiz saved my streak!")
- Shareable stories ("My AI knew I was about to skip")
- Deeper trust in the app

**How It Works:**
```
Pattern Detection:
├── User usually logs lunch by 1pm
├── Today it's 2pm and no log
├── Historical: 70% chance of skip when lunch missed
└── TRIGGER: Send preventive notification

Notification:

**Prediction Factors:**
- Time of usual activities vs current time
- Day of week patterns (weekends different from weekdays)
- Weather (rainy days = lower activity historically)
- Fasting state (extended fasts correlate with skipped workouts)
- Sleep data (poor sleep = lower engagement)
- Stress indicators (multiple skipped logs = struggling)

**Cross-Pillar Intelligence:**
```
Pattern: User who fasts 18h+ on workout days has 40% streak break rate

Proactive Intervention:
"You're scheduled for Push Day and currently 16h fasted.
 Historically, this combination leads to skipped workouts.
 Want me to suggest a lighter workout or eating first?"
```
